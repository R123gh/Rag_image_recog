index,chunk_num,text
0,0,"Okay, now let's make it more interactive.  Let's take input from the user  rather than us deciding what we want  the variables value to be, what should be the number"
0,1,.  Let's ask the user what is their choice.
1,0,"Let's make the results dependent on what user chooses to do.  So in that case, we have a lot of classes,  a lot of different ways to get an input  from the user on the command line"
1,1,.  But here we are going to use scanner class.
2,0,Scanner class is available in java.util.  So definitely we'll be importing that package.  And here we'll create these two lines are quite important
2,1,".  First of all, we'll create an object of the scanner class."
3,0,"So it says scanner obj, you can give it any name  equal to new scanner, then system.in  just to get the input from the user in the command line  and give it to the scanner class"
3,1,".  Then int a, int would be the data type,  a the variable name, equal to whatever name  you've given to the object.  Here it's obj, obj.nextint.  Let's have a look at it in the practical way."
4,0,"So here we have defined a class  simply user input as its name,  imported java.util, simply scanner,  we've created an object of the scanner class"
4,1,.  Then system.out.println we have shown  or we've displayed enter a number.  Now the user should enter the number.
5,0,"Now where does the input go?  It goes in this variable, int a, you can give it any name,  int a, next int, I'm sorry,  you'll need to use the object name,  obj.nextint, compile it, no syntax errors"
5,1,.  So what difference does it make?  It makes a difference there.  Now they are asking for an input.
6,0,"Enter a number, four, press enter.  So now we are entering a number.  Let's make it better."
7,0,"Now let's make the user enter another number.  Enter another number, we can use the same statement.  Now we'll print the sum of a and b  or we can say the sum of both the numbers is, let's see."
8,0,"So how we get input from the user?  Enter a number, we enter three.  Enter another number, we enter seven.  The sum of both the numbers is 10."
9,0,So now we are in control
9,1,".  The user, rather than just using the predefined ones,  the ones that we've defined in the program,  we are taking input from the user,  enter a number, then enter another number"
9,2,",  enter a number, then enter another number,  then it adds the numbers and gives you the result"
9,3,.  So input processes it and the output.
10,0,"Okay, so time for making your own project here. We'll just try and incorporate everything that  we've learned in this course"
10,1,". We'll try and implement it and use it as much as possible,  all the if-else statements, all the loops, switch case, everything that we've learned,  we'll try and incorporate it."
11,0,"So let's start with our project here. We'll have,  we'll display a menu for the user and then user himself can choose which one, what to do"
11,1,".  So we'll be giving an option, we'll be giving them, we'll be using switch case here in the  first one."
12,0,"Okay, let's start. So like any, any other program, we will start it with main function.  Now let's define a scanner class, a scanner object, I mean."
13,0,"So using the scanner class,  we'll take the input. So as you can see, it's underlined because we have not imported  java.util. Let's import that now. Here, now let's see."
14,0,Let's display a menu for the user.  We'll do certain things for the user. So enter one to check if a number is even or odd.
15,0,"Let's  display three more, two more of these. So the user, the user should enter two to divide two  numbers. User should enter three to join two strings."
16,0,So we've displayed a menu here.  Let's take in the user's choice. We need to use it with the object.
17,0,There you have it. Now we've taken user's choice in the choice variable. So it's stored there.
18,0,"We'll be using switch case here. The variable that we'll be using is choice.  In case the user states one, what should we do? We will call a function called even odd."
19,0,"And then so it's telling us that there's no such function, but we'll be defining it later. So you  do not need to worry about it. So now even odd, that is first one."
20,0,"Let's just define the default  one as well. Default, just in case the user hasn't entered one, it will, this one would be executed  invalid input"
20,1,". Okay, let's let's have the other two switch cases, other two cases as well."
21,0,"So just keep it aligned. So there's clarity. Then the other one would be divide,  this one would be join."
22,0,"So these three functions that we've used, in case the choice is one,  then even odd would be executed. Make sure you use break. Otherwise, each one of them would be  executed."
23,0,"Now, outside this function, let's define another function here. First one would be even  odd. So as you can see here, we are not passing any arguments."
24,0,So we are not passing any arguments  here while we are calling it. So these brackets are also empty. And there would be no return type  as well.
25,0,We are not returning it we are we are doing everything in this one itself. So you do  not need to write here in float anything like that you don't have to. So now we'll take an input from  user.
26,0,"Let's do that. So we are asking for the user to enter a number you can again, create an object  here"
26,1,". Now one thing that you need to notice is that we need to create another, another object  here, we always whenever a variable be a choice."
27,0,"So if it's declared, its scope is within this  function only the function that it is defined in is the only place where it's valid. If I try to  use choice anywhere else, it would not work"
27,1,. So it will work only within this region.
28,0,"So because  it's a local variable, just in case I wanted to be global, I'll just define it here, just saying  not doing it right now"
28,1,". But then if you define it here, then you can use it throughout the class.  Anyways, so coming back to our function."
29,0,Now we'll check if a that the the number that you  user has entered is odd or even. Let's make an else block here. So we have defined it.
30,0,Let's just  compile it. Before compiling it. Let's comment out these because we haven't really created these  functions.
31,0,"So it will show us an error, just comment it out so that it does not interrupt  the compiling compiled with no error. Let's execute it"
31,1,". Let's execute it. So now it's asking us for an input,  we enter one, it's an even number."
32,0,"If we try to enter anything else.  For example, if I try to enter even two here, it's in issues invalid input. So let's do half of  it."
33,0,"After this, half of our project is done."
34,0,"Okay, now completing the rest of the project, let's remove these clashes here.  Okay, now let's define divide first of all, within the same class"
34,1,".  So again, similar way similarly, public static, again, it would not return anything, then  divide."
35,0,"And now it will divide numbers, again, it will ask for a number, we can just copy it  from here, rather than just typing it all again"
35,1,".  So first, we define a scanner class again, a scanner object again, and then let's just  take input, enter a number, enter another number"
35,2,".  Now we can simply, let's define it float as we are going to divide them, there is a high  possibility that we have to add, we'll have decimal values."
36,0,"So this is how you will do it.  Okay, compile, we can compile it.  But before that, just an exception that could actually happen."
37,0,"What if B is entered as zero, if A is entered as zero, it won't be a problem.  But in case B is entered as zero, it would be a big issue"
37,1,".  So to deal with it, what we can do is just write, if B is equal equal to zero, then we'll  print something else, we'll print do not enter zero."
38,0,"So that would help, it's just like throwing out an exception.  So that would be very helpful.  Then, if not, then we can simply just print the quotient or the whatever is the output  after division."
39,0,"So let's try and compile it.  Although, yes, we haven't defined this one.  So we'll define it as well."
40,0,"We need to join two strings, and its name should be string.  So let's just define the last function that we are left with.  So we'll be taking input from user, again, the same thing."
41,0,"Let's Yeah, we need to take two inputs here.  So the data type would be string"
41,1,".  So the data type would be string.  You can also change the name, but it's not mandatory as we do not as this as A and B up  there was just valid within the method."
42,0,"So you don't have to, it's not really important.  Okay, enter a string.  We're going to ask for a string."
43,0,"Yes, it shows some error.  Okay, yes.  Okay, we can simply just, okay, just join two strings."
44,0,"So the first string could be Java.  Just simply join these.  And the second one could be, now let's display that what both of these are."
45,0,"The first string is str1, str sorry, then the second one.  So how do we concat it?  Let's see, str.concat str2"
45,1,".  You can also use the plus sign here, you can just simply join it without the concat function  as well."
46,0,"Let's see what's the error here.  Okay, we did not use, okay, no syntax errors.  Let's see if everything works."
47,0,"So it shows odd number.  Then in case we want to divide two numbers, then we'll enter 2, 6, and then 8, 6 and 7.  So it gives us the output.  In case we enter 0, let's check that as well."
48,0,"So we entered 2.  Now enter a number, we enter 6, and then we enter 0.  Do not enter 0.  So it shows us that we shouldn't enter 0.  So it's working perfectly fine"
48,1,".  So it's working perfectly fine.  Now the last one, to join two strings.  So it shows us the first string is Java, second one is programming."
49,0,"After concatenation, the string is Java programming.  You can just give a little space after is, otherwise, it's all right."
50,0,"OK, so moving further now, we'll understand the if, else, if else statements."
51,0,As you can see in this program we've defined 2 variables.
52,0,We are taking input from the user in the variable A&B.
53,0,Now in the first if statement what we are doing is that we are checking if A is greater than B.
54,0,If A is greater than B we'll we'll tell the user the first number is the greater.
55,0,"Whereas if the case is opposite, if B is greater than A, then we'll say, well, the second number is greater."
56,0,Now the else block contains the last possibility that both numbers are equal.
57,0,"So just logically speaking, if A is in greater than, B&B is in greater than."
58,0,A.
59,0,"Then there's only one possibility, and that is that both are equal."
60,0,Find it that we can use as many as if else blocks as much as we want.
61,0,There's no condition placed after else but.
62,0,Else if statement just like if has space for expressions that return true or false.
63,0,Now let's check the working compiled.
64,0,Now let's see.
65,0,When I enter 5.
66,0,"It says enter another number, second number is greater."
67,0,Let's check if.
68,0,What if we enter both of them?
69,0,"Six, both are equal."
70,0,So that is how it works.
71,0,Both are equal.
72,0,So this is how if else statement works.
73,0,Now let's close it.
74,0,Let's move on to the second type.
75,0,Now the second type is switch case.
76,0,This is known as switch case.
77,0,Nothing different.
78,0,Nothing.
79,0,New except this block.
80,0,Which I'd be explaining right away.
81,0,Now we defined A variable int day is equal to 3.
82,0,Then I use the word switch brackets and then I put in the variable that I want the switch case for.
83,0,Then I write various cases when case 1A column.
84,0,"If the case is 1, by which we mean if the value of day is 1, then it should be Monday."
85,0,Print Monday.
86,0,Then I use a break statement.
87,0,Now what break statement does is it would not execute the cases or anything after it.
88,0,"No, the control would flow from this line to right outside here after this block."
89,0,So.
90,0,"After this bracket, the control would flow directly from here to here."
91,0,It will not execute anymore lines of codes in lines of code in the switch case.
92,0,So using a break statement is important.
93,0,It is also called a jump statement.
94,0,Now the last one when the case is due then it's Tuesday.
95,0,If it's three then Wednesday.
96,0,Let's suppose that like we we can see here the day is 3 equal to .
97,0,So it will check this now false wrong.
98,0,Then it will move to case two.
99,0,It won't execute this one because the case is in two.
100,0,Then three ohh yes it matches 3 and case 3.
101,0,So it will print Wednesday and break come out of the switch case.
102,0,"Now just in case none of them is true, let's suppose the day is 10 or 20 or something."
103,0,Then we have a statement.
104,0,It's called default.
105,0,"So just in case all of them are false, it will print wrong input."
106,0,Let's check it compile.
107,0,It shows us Wednesday.
108,0,Let's enter 7.
109,0,The day is 7.
110,0,The result would be Sunday.
111,0,And in case we enter.
112,0,"In case in case we enter some random number, let's say 800 and 989."
113,0,"OK, compile."
114,0,Now none of the cases are equal to 89.
115,0,Let's see the result.
116,0,Hence proved that last statement is the one that would be executed.
117,0,That would be wrong input.
118,0,So switch case.
119,0,With switch case a few things.
120,0,We can also use character.
121,0,We can also use a constant expression here for example 6.
122,0,Into.
123,0,Nine that can be used here.
124,0,"So whatever the answer is of this, that would be the case."
125,0,That is what that would be the value that would be the one that compared OK.
126,0,"Other than that, we can use character data type here."
127,0,"But using double for example 8.9897, this is something that's not a feature of switch case."
128,0,We cannot use decimal values here.
129,0,We also cannot use.
130,0,"Variables like a into B, No, that would be wrong."
131,0,So anything that's constant and is not in decimals can be used.
132,0,These are the few rules that we need to follow while using the switch case.
133,0,"Further, we'll understand variables in data types in Java."
134,0,"So in Java we have various data types and they have their sizes, specific sizes."
135,0,"For example, for character we have."
136,0,A data type called care.
137,0,It takes up two bytes in the memory.
138,0,"Byte, like the name suggests it takes 1 byte."
139,0,Short takes up two bytes.
140,0,"Integer takes up 4, long 8."
141,0,So you can read it here.
142,0,Boolean takes one bit.
143,0,"Now for a character, we can store ABC any single character."
144,0,"It could be even space, it could be a symbol, a number, just that it should be in double quotes."
145,0,We'll understand it in this video itself further.
146,0,"Byte, short, int and long."
147,0,All these four data types store integer type values.
148,0,What do we mean by integer?
149,0,"So it will be two, 3-4, hundred, 122, anything like that But."
150,0,With no decimal spaces float in double.
151,0,"To the contrary, they take values that have decimal spaces, say 6.26.289."
152,0,"Any of those boolean stores two things, either true or false."
153,0,That's all.
154,0,Now have a look at variable declaration and assignment.
155,0,So this line right here is an example of how to declare a variable.
156,0,And this is the representation just to understand it better.
157,0,"So I've mentioned the data type, it's float like you can see."
158,0,We have decimal spaces here.
159,0,"A is name of the variable, so of the identifier."
160,0,You can give it any name then equal to the value.
161,0,Here float as the data type A is the variable equal to.
162,0,Is the assignment operator and.
163,0,This is a constant.
164,0,Again; We need to use after each and every statement in the memory.
165,0,Just to visualize it a little bit.
166,0,"We have a space, it has its own address."
167,0,Just just an example.
168,0,"We are giving it a name, that name is A and we are storing a constant."
169,0,"In that variable in that space, now we can change."
170,0,We can change it to any other number.
171,0,"So the name remains same, the location remains same, the constant can keep on changing."
172,0,We can.
173,0,"We can write a equal to 6, so that's when it will erase this one and enter 66.28."
174,0,"Anything we want to, we can overwrite it."
175,0,Simply speaking.
176,0,Let's take a look at it how to do this in a program.
177,0,"So opening Blue Jay again, we'll create a new class, give it a name, let's give it name sum a simple program here, so."
178,0,Let's start open it.
179,0,It has already been.
180,0,You can just.
181,0,It is it completely or just simply?
182,0,This right here is also a comment.
183,0,"Anyways, we do not need it, so we've defined a class public class sum now again."
184,0,So here we'll define a variable.
185,0,Keep it very simple.
186,0,Int a is equal to 2.
187,0,"B is equal to 9, so you can separate it with a comma and then later on put a semi column there we want to print the sum of it."
188,0,So it will be.
189,0,We'll just print a plus.
190,0,B.
191,0,So what is happening right here?
192,0,Plus is also an operator.
193,0,We'll study it further.
194,0,We'll study all the operators that are used in Java.
195,0,So this is the data type.
196,0,This is name of variable.
197,0,I've assigned IT12B has the value 9.
198,0,Then I've printed the sum of A&B.
199,0,"So as per our anticipation, the answer should be the sum of 12 and 9."
200,0,"Let's see, compile it, no errors."
201,0,Then just run it.
202,0,So the sum here is 21 as you can see.
203,0,"So this is how to declare a variable, how to use data types and then use it."
204,0,"OK, so let's have a look at strings."
205,0,"In Java, Strings are nothing but they are text, just like you can see here first how we define a string."
206,0,It's string just like a data type integer.
207,0,Then we give it a name and then.
208,0,We assign the value here.
209,0,Now string is not a upfront straight away.
210,0,"It's not a data type, rather it is."
211,0,"It is a data type, but it's not a primary data type."
212,0,It's at the back end.
213,0,It's an array.
214,0,Now array is nothing but a combination of.
215,0,"A data type, so various locations of a data type."
216,0,"So what I mean by that is just like it has been defined here, JVA are characters and it has been combined to make a string."
217,0,"So a string in Java cannot be changed later on, we cannot expand it."
218,0,Because it is defined as an array.
219,0,Now there are a few functions that we can use with the strings.
220,0,These are a few.
221,0,There are a lot more that you can discover on your own.
222,0,Let's dive into it.
223,0,Let's see how to work with arrays.
224,0,"I mean, sorry, how to work with strings?"
225,0,"OK, have a look at it."
226,0,Let's define.
227,0,A class named String use.
228,0,"OK, so let's define a string and the string."
229,0,Why we do not need to import a function or any import a class or anything that is because.
230,0,String is stored in Java Lang which is the default package.
231,0,So we do not need to import any external package here String let's call it STR we'll call it.
232,0,Java is a language.
233,0,So this is our string.
234,0,Now how to work with this string we'll first of all we'll display it.
235,0,Let's.
236,0,Let's see the results.
237,0,So the original String is Java is a language.
238,0,Now let's have a look at what we can do with this string.
239,0,So now.
240,0,Let's suppose I want to change it to uppercase.
241,0,"I want all the letters to be capital, so I'll just use a function here STR dot."
242,0,2.
243,0,Upper.
244,0,Case.
245,0,"As it's a function, we'll have this."
246,0,We'll be using dot.
247,0,And.
248,0,We'll also have these.
249,0,Brackets here.
250,0,Let's check.
251,0,Wait.
252,0,The original string is this.
253,0,So.
254,0,"The string, we can write it the string."
255,0,In upper case.
256,0,"Similarly, we have another one here."
257,0,So it will.
258,0,We'll just write lower here and it will convert it into.
259,0,Lower case.
260,0,"OK, we'll see that later."
261,0,"Now we have many other functions that we can use here, the string."
262,0,After replacing.
263,0,Java with.
264,0,Guava.
265,0,"OK, now what we'll do here?"
266,0,We'll use a different function.
267,0,Dot replace.
268,0,Now in the first section we will be passing arguments here in Java.
269,0,Cover.
270,0,"What we've done here, the first argument is the one that we are looking for the search element."
271,0,So it will be looking for Java and then replacing it with Kava.
272,0,Let's execute it and say.
273,0,OK.
274,0,OK.
275,0,Let's compile it.
276,0,Make sure you keep a check on the semicolons and the brackets and everything.
277,0,OK.
278,0,"And the pop up is here, OK?"
279,0,Let's turn it off.
280,0,Let's try to execute.
281,0,"OK, there you go."
282,0,"So the original string is this, the string in uppercase, the lowercase replacing Java with Carver?"
283,0,"Let's do something else here now, Carat."
284,0,So we have another one.
285,0,The character.
286,0,Add index.
287,0,3.
288,0,Is.
289,0,Now this one takes the value.
290,0,"C should be small OK, so."
291,0,We are looking for character that is at 3.
292,0,So let me know what you are expecting.
293,0,What would be the character at third index?
294,0,The index starts from here.
295,0,"At 3rd place, what is the?"
296,0,Character.
297,0,So now the character are third place is a but you would say it's BY.
298,0,"Is it a cause the index starts from zero in a string, so the at 0 it's J, at one it's a second, at second position it's B."
299,0,"And 3rd, it is a so this is how it's working."
300,0,These are a few functions that we can use.
301,0,We have a few more as well.
302,0,Let's let's test all of them.
303,0,So we want to know.
304,0,The index.
305,0,Off.
306,0,L.
307,0,So the function for that is.
308,0,Index of.
309,0,And we'll pass.
310,0,And here.
311,0,"Index of L is 10, so if you count from here 012345678910, make sure you also count the white spaces in between."
312,0,They also take up space so you cannot just ignore it.
313,0,So it won't be like 0123.
314,0,Then we just go to I4 nodes.
315,0,The space is also counted here.
316,0,That would be index.
317,0,So we have various functions like this.
318,0,You can just keep on trying a few more.
319,0,You can just have a look at them and just play around with it.
320,0,It will be easy for you.
321,0,So this is how we define a string.
322,0,These are a few functions that we can use.
323,0,With the strings.
324,0,"OK, so let's start here."
325,0,"First of all, we'll learn what is the method we've been talking about member functions, functions, methods."
326,0,These all are the same things.
327,0,It's called method or a function.
328,0,How to define it?
329,0,Well you'll need an access specifier.
330,0,"It could be public, private."
331,0,Then you can use the keyword static.
332,0,Then the return type.
333,0,Return type is data type.
334,0,What kind of value are you going to return?
335,0,Then methods name then list of arguments.
336,0,So our input goes here and the return type will be defined here.
337,0,A return keyword would be used within the method in the method body.
338,0,Then we have how to call a function?
339,0,Well to call a function simply write the name.
340,0,And in brackets you pass the arguments that you want to.
341,0,Let's have a look at it how it looks practically.
342,0,So we've defined.
343,0,A simple class here it's called methods.
344,0,Let's define a function here public.
345,0,Static.
346,0,Let's return into.
347,0,This time we'll return integer type.
348,0,It's called add.
349,0,The functions name is add then.
350,0,String.
351,0,Argument.
352,0,Now further sorry you don't you'll pass on the arguments like int A as we are adding 2SO2 variables int AEA&B return.
353,0,A+.
354,0,B.
355,0,So you are returning it.
356,0,What we've done here is this is a class.
357,0,This is a function that I've defined in that class.
358,0,Its name is add.
359,0,"OK for now, it won't do anything because we are not calling it anywhere."
360,0,We are not utilizing it.
361,0,"We are not using it, but when we call it, that is when it will work."
362,0,So let's see.
363,0,Let's create the main function.
364,0,That's where the execution starts from.
365,0,So what we'll do here is we are simply going to.
366,0,"Call this function, it says."
367,0,Let's define a variable should be C Now when we call this function.
368,0,Add we'll pass arguments.
369,0,We passed 22.
370,0,Plus 22.
371,0,So it should return 44.
372,0,"So these two arguments, let me just make it a little different."
373,0,Okay?
374,0,42 should be the answer.
375,0,"22 goes into A, 20 goes into B."
376,0,The return word is used in the brackets.
377,0,"We pass whatever we want to return here, so the return would be 42."
378,0,So C should be equal.
379,0,"42 here, then we just print the result."
380,0,So there you go.
381,0,Compiled.
382,0,Let's check what's the output.
383,0,The output is.
384,0,The sum is 42.
385,0,So what happened here is that we had a class.
386,0,We've defined 2 functions.
387,0,One is the one that adds 2 numbers and returns the sum.
388,0,"We called it here In this way, these arguments are called actual."
389,0,Parameters.
390,0,These are called formal parameters.
391,0,You make sure you define the data type here so everything goes smooth.
392,0,Now let's give it another try.
393,0,Now let's try something different.
394,0,What if I try to call it?
395,0,Outside this class.
396,0,"So the class is public, the method is public."
397,0,Let's try it.
398,0,"OK, let's create another class Create."
399,0,Let's create it.
400,0,Here I'm gonna call it.
401,0,Umm.
402,0,Let's call it main.
403,0,And you should notice something that this main and that main are different.
404,0,Java is.
405,0,Case sensitive.
406,0,So this mean with starting with a capital letter is different from the other one.
407,0,OK So what I did here is I pasted the same code.
408,0,We are trying to call the add function but it shows us an error.
409,0,It says undeclared method.
410,0,We do not recognize it.
411,0,We don't know what you're talking about.
412,0,AD is not a function here.
413,0,Now what we do about it.
414,0,So like I told you.
415,0,So as you can see.
416,0,"As you can see, this is a different class."
417,0,This is a different class.
418,0,"So whenever we are trying to access members of another class, what we need to do is we'll create an object of that class."
419,0,So the classes name was methods.
420,0,"I'm giving it a name, I'll call it OB now new."
421,0,Methods.
422,0,So I have.
423,0,Created.
424,0,An object.
425,0,"Now, when I need to call any member of this class methods that we defined earlier, I'll use the object."
426,0,"OB dot whatever is the name of the object, whatever is it, you'll use that."
427,0,Now let's compile it and it should run.
428,0,"Yes, it compiles."
429,0,Now one thing you can see here that the main function got connected with the main class got connected with the methods function.
430,0,"So a function that's defined in the methods class is being used in the main class, here the add function."
431,0,"As we can see there is no method defined here that is called add, but it is defined in the methods class."
432,0,So keeping it simple.
433,0,Let's execute it and we want the answer to be 42.
434,0,We are executing the main class not the other one.
435,0,The answer remains same that sum is 42 just in case you not.
436,0,Selected this option Clear screen at method call.
437,0,"You might be getting new new outputs with the previous ones still on the console, so you can select this."
438,0,"I think it's pretty late to tell you that, but yes."
439,0,So clear screen at method calls sometimes by default.
440,0,The screen won't be cleared by the while we execute it.
441,0,The previous outputs would still be visible.
442,0,So just select this option.
443,0,OK yes.
444,0,Video8
445,0,Hello students so we are going to start our course here which is known as basics of Java.
446,0,"So you will be learning basic concepts of Java, how to write a program in Java, perform in various perform various tasks in Java."
447,0,"Before we dive into it, let's start with what Java is exactly."
448,0,So Java is an object oriented programming language.
449,0,What we mean by.
450,0,Object Oriented programming language.
451,0,We'll definitely discuss it just in a bit.
452,0,But just you should know that Java is an object oriented programming language.
453,0,There are various other object oriented programming languages.
454,0,"For example, C is one of the examples."
455,0,Now where do we use Java?
456,0,Java is used to make Android applications it.
457,0,"We used to make web applications mobile games, so it is employed at various."
458,0,Places it's employed in various projects Now a little bit of the history of Java.
459,0,It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1990.
460,0,It was originally known as Oak.
461,0,"Later on its name was changed to Java, which was I think based on name of a coffee."
462,0,"OK, now let's understand when we say Java is an object oriented programming language, what do we mean exactly?"
463,0,So here there are various basic concepts of Java.
464,0,But here two major concepts of Java object in the class.
465,0,Well an object is an instance of class.
466,0,By instance of a classmate we mean that it is just like an example of a class.
467,0,And what is a class?
468,0,A class is a blueprint of an object.
469,0,"Or just like you can say that a class is just like a template, so a template which can be used to create various objects."
470,0,So class is a general template of a thing and we can create various objects of it now for example here.
471,0,You can see that a vehicle vehicle is the class here example.
472,0,Just taking it as an example from our real life.
473,0,"So when we say a vehicle, vehicle has vehicle could be any, it could be an airplane, it could be a train, it could be a car, bus, scooter, any of these."
474,0,So here we have taken a few examples.
475,0,So here we cycle is a class.
476,0,So a vehicle will have its own functionality.
477,0,We know a vehicle can have a maximum speed.
478,0,"Each and every vehicle would have a maximum speed, minimum speed."
479,0,It will have various other features.
480,0,"How many wheels it has, what?"
481,0,Color it is.
482,0,So all these things come under a vehicle.
483,0,A vehicle would have some properties.
484,0,"Now when we go in deeper, we'll see a car is the type of a vehicle."
485,0,"Now here we'll see that a car has its own specific details, OK."
486,0,One could be red in color.
487,0,It has four wheels.
488,0,Its maximum speed is 120 kilometer per hour.
489,0,"Similarly, a bus has its own properties."
490,0,"A scooter, it has two wheels rather than four."
491,0,"So it has its own properties, but all of them have wheels."
492,0,"OK, so a general."
493,0,Template.
494,0,A general way of calling them would be a Vehicle.
495,0,So Vehicle here is a class and all these are its objects.
496,0,No.
497,0,"Moving further, what's the difference between an object in a class?"
498,0,You do not have to worry about it if you do not understand it.
499,0,"Now when we do practice it practically while we are coding, you will definitely understand it."
500,0,So do not worry about it now.
501,0,"Here, just like we discussed, an object is an instance of class."
502,0,"A class is a collection of objects, so we can either call it a collection of objects or we can call it a blueprint of an object."
503,0,We can create multiple objects of a single class.
504,0,So we can also term it as collection of objects.
505,0,Now as the class is just a template so it does not take up any space on the memory.
506,0,Whereas when it comes to an object whenever we create an object of a class.
507,0,It does take up space on the memory.
508,0,Now taking it simply how when it comes to the coding part.
509,0,So how do we declare a class?
510,0,How we create a class?
511,0,So a class starts with class keyword.
512,0,Then you will give it a name.
513,0,You can give it any name.
514,0,"I've given it my class, that's the name."
515,0,Then curly brackets open.
516,0,The content will be included in these curly brackets.
517,0,That is how we will define a class.
518,0,"Now of the same class, whenever we want to create an object, first of all the name of the class."
519,0,"Whichever class it is, its name would go here."
520,0,Then object you can give it.
521,0,Any name I've given it obj equal to new.
522,0,Now new keyword is used here.
523,0,Then my class again the name of the name of the class round brackets; Make sure you put a semi colon here.
524,0,There are statements in Java where you have to put I think most of the statements.
525,0,Need a semi colon so you might write a whole code.
526,0,"It's all good, no errors."
527,0,But a semi colon might cause an issue and you might not be able to execute it.
528,0,So make sure you put a semi colon there.
529,0,"So that is the basic difference between a class and object, OK?"
530,0,"OK, let's have a look at these jump statements."
531,0,Now break.
532,0,"We've already seen in the switch case, but we'll just go over it again and continue."
533,0,These are two jump statements that help us jump from one line of code to the other while the execution is still on.
534,0,"So here we have a class, simply we've named it Jump State."
535,0,Let's define a for loop here int I.
536,0,"So in normal execution, we'll try."
537,0,We are printing eye here.
538,0,So now simply let's see what it does.
539,0,"So as we've already done it in the loop, it will print numbers zero to 10."
540,0,But now I want to show you how to use.
541,0,What does a break statement do?
542,0,So if.
543,0,I is equal equal to 5.
544,0,Then.
545,0,Break.
546,0,"So what a break statement would do is in case this block is executed, the control from this line would come out of the loop, which means the loop would be terminated."
547,0,"Let's see, although this loop should loop should go on."
548,0,Until it it prints zero to 10.
549,0,Let's see what happens when we add a break statement here.
550,0,"So there you go, 01234 and five."
551,0,So what happened here is when?
552,0,"It was equal to five this statement, this block of code was executed and the control came out of the loop."
553,0,So it never went back and checked these got incremented or checked the condition to iterate again.
554,0,"No, it was terminated."
555,0,Let's see what a continue statement does so now.
556,0,Working of break statement and a continuous statement are similar but.
557,0,How does it differ?
558,0,Can you notice something here?
559,0,There's something missing 5 is missing here.
560,0,Why?
561,0,The continuous statement works similar to the break statement.
562,0,"Whenever it's executed, it terminates the loop."
563,0,"But sorry, it does not terminate the loop, rather it ignores whatever is after it for one time."
564,0,"So when it was 5, continuous statement was executed and what happened is this line right here was ignored."
565,0,And the iteration and it moves to the next iteration.
566,0,That is how it works.
567,0,"Breaks statements, simply terminates the loop continuous statement."
568,0,"Ignores the part of a loop, a block of set after it, and continues with the next iteration."
569,0,Whereas that is not true for a break statement.
570,0,Break statement completely terminates it and never goes back.
571,0,So now here we'll understand what are packages in Java.
572,0,"Well packages in Java are a collection of similar classes, interfaces and sub packages."
573,0,For now you can just take it as these are a collection of classes functions.
574,0,Which can be used now.
575,0,These are of two types.
576,0,Built in and user defined.
577,0,So built in packages are those that are already loaded in the compiler in the JDK and you can just use them.
578,0,"You don't have to define them, you don't have to define a function, you don't have to define what task this has to perform."
579,0,"You can just import it and use it, as simple as that."
580,0,"And user defined packages are those, We can Group A few classes and we can name it as a package."
581,0,Those are called user defined packages.
582,0,Now we have a few examples of built-in packages.
583,0,The examples here are Java dot IO.
584,0,Now it includes various classes.
585,0,"I've mentioned a few classes here, buffer, reader, input stream, output stream."
586,0,So these are all used while taking an input.
587,0,Then we have Java Lang.
588,0,"It is a default package, by which I mean that you do not have to import it or explicitly mention that I want to use this package and it's classes in my program."
589,0,"No, you don't have to."
590,0,All these are already by default loaded.
591,0,Then we have Java dot util.
592,0,Java dot util contains classes like a Scanner class.
593,0,"Scanner classes used to take input again then date, time zone."
594,0,So whenever you want to use.
595,0,These kind of classes where you need the time zone and date of a user you can use Java dot util.
596,0,Then we have Java dot SQL.
597,0,So it basically like the name suggests SQL.
598,0,"So SQL is used for databases, so it's used for database connectivity."
599,0,We whenever we want to connect our Android or any other application to a database.
600,0,That is when we use it the Java application whenever it needs the database connectivity.
601,0,Now let's have a look at how to use these packages in our program.
602,0,Let's start with it.
603,0,Now packages.
604,0,So let's define a.
605,0,Class named package use.
606,0,This is where we'll learn how to use the package.
607,0,So.
608,0,OK.
609,0,So we've defined it.
610,0,Let's remove.
611,0,Comments and everything that we do not really need here.
612,0,OK.
613,0,So here we've defined it now just for an example.
614,0,Let's say we want to use the Scanner class here Scanner.
615,0,"I'll explain it further later on, but let's say Scanner."
616,0,It's the name of the class like I told you how to create an object new.
617,0,Scanner here.
618,0,We can.
619,0,In the brackets we can pass an argument.
620,0,"We'll be passing system in so that whatever input we get, we get it."
621,0,We get it to the Scanner class now.
622,0,Scanner class let let me try to use it.
623,0,"Now when I'm trying to use it, it's showing me some suggestions and it's telling me that the package or the class, I'm sorry, the class has not been defined."
624,0,"So to do that, like we read earlier, it is present in Java util."
625,0,So what we'll do is we'll use the keyword.
626,0,Import.
627,0,"Then Java dot util dot*; Now when we compile it, it shows no syntax errors, although it won't do anything."
628,0,We've just created an object and done nothing.
629,0,But this is how it works.
630,0,So what do we mean by this* So what it does is it will import all the classes that are present in the Java util package.
631,0,So all the classes be it Scanner class be it any other class.
632,0,"It will import it, but just in case we just want a single class, we don't want to use any other we can after the dot, we can just write that single class's name as well."
633,0,It won't show us any error as we just want to use a specific class from this package.
634,0,So this is how you import any package.
635,0,"start_time,end_time,text"
636,0,"0.0,8.7,""Now moving further as we have already understood three types of operators arithmetic, relational"""
637,0,"8.7,9.7,and logical."
638,0,"9.7,15.38,""Now let us move on to assignment operators, one of which we have already used a simple"""
639,0,"15.38,18.1,equal to we have already used."
640,0,"18.1,24.54,We can let us understand what are the other operators that have been mentioned in the assignment"
641,0,"24.54,25.54,operator."
642,0,"25.54,27.54,So let us see."
643,0,"28.54,35.78,""So simply here we can see that a is equal to 12, that means that 12 is the value of"""
644,0,"35.78,36.78,a."
645,0,"36.78,41.94,Now we have a different way of overwriting it."
646,0,"41.94,46.06,So we can overwrite it simply as a is equal to 9."
647,0,"46.06,54.74,""So now when we try to print a, it will show us 9 rather than 12."""
648,0,"54.74,63.34,So like I said earlier that it raises the previous value now the value of a is 9 as we"
649,0,"63.34,65.46,have printing a."
650,0,"65.46,71.3,Now let us suppose we want to add a number to a."
651,0,"71.3,75.7,We want a is equal to a plus 5."
652,0,"75.7,84.7,Now what do we mean by this that here the result will be as per 12 plus 5."
653,0,"84.7,93.9,So now a new value would be assigned to a which would be 12 which is a plus 5."
654,0,"93.9,98.22,12 plus 5 would be 18."
655,0,"98.22,102.22,Let us compile it."
656,0,"102.22,108.06,So are we 17 it will be 17."
657,0,"108.06,112.46,So it has successfully added it."
658,0,"112.46,121.18,Now rather than doing this what we can simply do is a plus equal to."
659,0,"121.18,131.86,Now it will work in a similarly it is nothing but it is a is equal to a plus 5."
660,0,"131.86,139.34,So no difference here we can write it as this or we can write it as this."
661,0,"139.34,154.3,Now by let again no errors let us run it."
662,0,"154.3,156.74,I think the terminal is open."
663,0,"156.74,161.58,So no difference."
664,0,"161.58,166.74,So that would be assignment operators."
665,0,"166.74,173.62,So the other operators would also work in a similar way it will subtract multiply divide"
666,0,"173.62,176.3,finding modulus and everything."
667,0,"176.3,180.5,Now next we have increment and decrement."
668,0,"180.5,182.74,Let us have a look at this."
669,0,"182.74,185.9,This is a very interesting operator."
670,0,"185.9,188.1,So let us see."
671,0,"188.1,196.7,Now here what I do is I simply write it is a unary operator means we can"
672,0,"196.7,202.38,use it with a single variable we do not need a bc equal to nothing."
673,0,"202.38,210.9,Now a plus plus what this would do is it will increment the value by 1."
674,0,"210.9,216.06,So it will add 1 to it."
675,0,"216.06,220.42,Let us see just yeah."
676,0,"220.42,223.98,Okay let us have a look at it."
677,0,"224.02,231.42,So the original value was 12 it has incremented it to 13."
678,0,"231.42,234.5,But there is a difference."
679,0,"234.5,238.78,This is something that we need to understand."
680,0,"238.78,246.54,We can write it as a plus plus or plus plus a."
681,0,"246.54,249.18,It makes a difference."
682,0,"249.18,253.74,Now what difference it makes is when we write plus plus a it"
683,0,"253.74,259.94,means that it will increment it increment the value right there and then."
684,0,"259.94,263.22,So 12 here here the value is 13."
685,0,"263.22,266.1,So when we print a it is 13."
686,0,"266.1,276.26,But when we do a plus plus what it does is 12 still here the value is 12."
687,0,"276.26,282.94,But when it is used the next time that is when the value would be 13."
688,0,"282.94,285.22,Let me show you a difference."
689,0,"285.22,294.18,So what I will do is rather than using it here to prove my point I am going to use it here"
690,0,"294.18,297.18,a plus plus."
691,0,"297.18,306.06,Now let us see what would be the answer would it be 12 or 13 compile it."
692,0,"306.06,311.18,Let us see."
693,0,"311.42,314.26,12 still 12."
694,0,"314.26,323.94,Now if we see it here if I do a plus plus a then compile it."
695,0,"323.94,324.94,Okay."
696,0,"324.94,326.94,We need another plus."
697,0,"326.94,328.94,Okay plus plus a."
698,0,"328.94,329.94,Okay."
699,0,"329.94,339.42,If it shows an error here it is just because of the brackets as it is not able to differentiate"
700,0,"339.46,347.18,what is the arguments or what the plus exactly needs to combine just add the brackets here"
701,0,"347.18,348.18,that would help."
702,0,"348.18,350.18,Okay compile."
703,0,"350.18,356.7,Now plus plus a means it will do it right then and there it will increment it."
704,0,"356.7,357.9,13."
705,0,"357.9,369.38,Same goes for minus minus we use the subtraction sign here what it will do is."
706,0,"369.38,371.38,The answer would be 11."
707,0,"371.38,376.86,Now the last one the last one is conditional operator."
708,0,"376.86,396.94,Now what is the conditional operator just commenting it here conditional operator is this one."
709,0,"396.94,403.74,Now a question mark how do we use it well it is very interesting."
710,0,"403.74,411.94,So what we do is let us take a let us just 12 and 9 simple."
711,0,"411.94,415.3,Let us declare another variable call it result."
712,0,"415.3,422.1,Now what it will do is it will compare these two and give us a result."
713,0,"422.1,427.98,Now how result is equal to."
714,0,"427.98,434.38,Now here is where the expression goes expression we can use the logical operators that"
715,0,"434.38,436.3,we have learned already."
716,0,"436.3,446.1,A is if A is greater than B then question mark."
717,0,"446.1,460.42,So we will add a question mark here then true otherwise a column forms."
718,0,"460.42,470.42,So we need to put it in quotations."
719,0,"470.42,477.7,Okay result."
720,0,"477.7,483.54,So what we are doing is just a second."
721,0,"483.54,498.74,Let us try and combine it."
722,0,"498.74,509.9,Okay anyways so what we are doing here is if A is greater than B then A would go here."
723,0,"509.9,517.3,If B is greater than 9 sorry B is greater which means it will return false then we will"
724,0,"517.3,519.58,have B here."
725,0,"519.58,526.54,So what actually goes here is if the statement if this expression is true if the statement"
726,0,"526.54,534.1,is true then this part would be executed the one before the column if it is false then this"
727,0,"534.1,538.7,part would be executed which is the next part."
728,0,"538.7,547.26,So now let us see."
729,0,"547.26,556.98,So now what it does is which so ever number among A or B is the greatest the result would"
730,0,"556.98,558.34,be that."
731,0,"558.34,566.18,So the bigger number when here the result should be 12 as per us as 12 is greater than"
732,0,"566.18,568.38,9 it should be 12."
733,0,"568.38,581.06,Let us suppose B was some other number let us say it was 90."
734,0,"581.06,586.9,Now in this case this expression would be false the second one should be printed the"
735,0,"586.9,593.34,result should contain the second one and the answer would be 90."

861,0,"Inside the main loop, we use conditional logic to check the value of angle."
862,0,"When the joystick is pushed to the right, the X axis value becomes very high, typically greater than 3500, and under this condition the servo rotates to 0°."

922,0,We begin by building the basic coding blocks and then declare A variable named distance which stores the value detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
923,0,The program continuously updates this value so the system always knows how far the obstacle is.
924,0,"Next, we add a condition to check if the distance is greater than 40 centimeters."
925,0,"If it is, the system shows a safe situation by turning on the green LED's, keeping the red LED off, and making sure the speaker stays silent."
926,0,Then we add another condition for when the distance is less than 40 centimeters.
927,0,"In this case, the system recognizes danger, so the red LED turns on, the green LED turns off, and the speaker starts beeping to warn that an obstacle is too close."
928,0,"After uploading the program, testing becomes very simple."
929,0,"When the sensor detects a larger safe distance, only the green light glows and no sound is produced."
930,0,"But when something approaches too closely, the warning light and alarm activate immediately."
931,0,"This project clearly demonstrates how ultrasonic sensing, conditional logic and output modules work together to create a real world safety device."
932,0,"It shows how the ultrasonic sensor acts like the eyes, constantly checking for objects, while the LED's and speaker act like the signals and voice that guide the user."
933,0,"Even though this is a small scale model, it works on the same principle used in modern cars to avoid collisions while reversing"
933,1,", making it an excellent beginner friendly example of applying sensors and programming to solve real problems effectively."
934,0,"In this project we create a button controlled fan system where the fan turns on or off depending on which button is pressed, using an add key input to read different analog values from each button."
935,0,"To build the code manually, we start with the basic setup."
936,0,"Blocks the when green flag clicked block and a forever loop, so the fan continuously responds to button presses."
937,0,Next we create a variable named item and inside the loop we assign the analog value from the AD key sensor to this variable.
938,0,The AD key module gives different analog readings for different buttons.
939,0,"So we use an if else condition to read these values and decide what the fan should do if the value of item is greater than 3500, which corresponds to pressing the red button."
940,0,We stop the fan by setting both motor pins low if the value is between 2030.
941,0,Which corresponds to pressing the yellow button.
942,0,We activate the fan by making the motor rotate.
943,0,These conditions allow the system to instantly react to whichever button the user presses.
944,0,After deciding the fan state.
945,0,We add a short delay of around 0.3 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in readings and make the button response smooth once uploaded to the board
945,1,", Pressing the yellow button makes the fan spin and pressing the red button."
946,0,"Turns it off, showing how simple button inputs can be used to control real hardware."
947,0,"This activity teaches how analog key modules work, how to read sensor values, and how conditions and motor control instructions together can create an efficient interactive device."
948,0,It's a fun introduction to digital input control and a practical demonstration of using buttons to manage electrical appliances in a safe and programmable way.
949,0,"In this video tutorial, we will learn how to create an automatic fan system that works using both temperature sensing and motion detection to save energy."
950,0,"During hot summer days, many public places use auto fans that turn on only when the surrounding temperature becomes too high."
951,0,"In this project, we will enhance that idea by adding a PIR motion sensor so the fan will run only when the temperature crosses the threshold and a person is detected nearby."
952,0,1st we create the basic setup blocks and then we declare A variable named temp.
953,0,Next we read the temperature sensor value and assign it to the temp variable so the program can continuously check the environment.
954,0,Then we add an if else block to compare the temperature value with the set limit such as 28°.
955,0,"If the value is higher, the program proceeds to the next condition."
956,0,"If not, the fan remains off."
957,0,After that we add another if else block to read the P IR sensor.
958,0,"If the par value is 1, meaning motion is detected, the fan turns on."
959,0,Otherwise it remains off after uploading the complete test code.
960,0,The system works automatically whenever the temperature rises above 28° and the PIR sensor detects someone the fan starts were tating.
961,0,"If either condition is not met, temperature too low, or no motion detected, the fan stays off, ensuring efficient and smart energy usage."
962,0,"In this activity, we create an automatic door system similar to those found in malls, where the door opens when a person approaches and closes when no one is near by."
963,0,"To build this program, we start with the basic initialization blocks."
964,0,Using the green flag and a forever loop to make sure the system keeps checking for movement.
965,0,Inside the loop we add a condition block to read the output of the PIR motion sensor.
966,0,"This sensor detects infrared radiation from human bodies, and it outputs one when someone is present and 0 when the area is clear."
967,0,"Based on this reading, we control a servo motor that represents the door."
968,0,"When the PR sensor detects motion, the servo rotates to 180°, which simulates the door opening."
969,0,"When no motion is detected, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door."
970,0,"By continuously evaluating the sensor values, the door responds automatically to people approaching and leaving."
971,0,"After uploading the code, simply wave your hand in front of the PIR sensor and the servo turns to 180°, opening the door."
972,0,"As soon as the center no longer detects movement, the servo slowly returns."
973,0,"In this project we create a simple access control system using an RFID module, a magnetic or IC card and a servo motor to simulate a real access door."
974,0,"The idea is that when the correct card is scanned, the door opens automatically and if the card is not recognized, the door stays locked."
975,0,"To build the program, we begin with the basic start and forever blocks, so the system constantly checks for a card."
976,0,"We initialize the RFID module so it can read card data, and then we create a string variable called ID card that stores the correct card code."
977,0,"Each user will have a different code, so you must replace the sample code with the one read from your own card."
978,0,"Inside the forever loop, we use a condition that compares the scanned RFID code with the stored."
979,0,ID card value.
980,0,"If the scanned code matches, it means the card is authorized and the servo rotates to 180° representing the door opening."
981,0,The servo holds this position for three seconds to allow the person to enter.
982,0,"After the delay, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door again."
983,0,"If the scant card does not match the stored code, the condition fails and the servo remains at 0°, indicating that the door is locked and access is denied."
984,0,"After uploading the program, simply place your card near the RFID sensor."
985,0,"If it is the correct card, the servo will smoothly rotate to open the door and then return to the closed position."
986,0,"If the card is incorrect, nothing happens demonstrating reliable and secure access control."
987,0,"This experiment clearly shows how RFID technology, variables and conditional logic can work together to build real world security systems similar to those used in offices"
987,1,", apartments and commercial buildings."
988,0,"In this video tutorial, we are going to learn how to build an automatic window closing system that reacts to changes in light."
989,0,This project uses a photo resistor as a light sensor and a servo motor to open and close the window.
990,0,The idea behind the project is simple.
991,0,"When the surrounding environment becomes dark, the system should automatically close the window for safety and energy efficiency."
992,0,The photo resistor plays a key role in detecting light intensity because its resistance changes according to the ambient light level.
993,0,We set a threshold value that determines when the window.
994,0,"Would close if the analog value of the photo resistor drops below this threshold, meaning the environment is dark, the servo rotates to 180°, simulating the closing of the window."
995,0,"Otherwise, when the value is higher than the threshold indicating daylight or sufficient brightness, the servo returns to 0°."
996,0,"Opening the window now, let's discuss the block coding process."
997,0,We begin by placing the basic initialization blocks for reading the photo resistor and controlling the servo motor.
998,0,Then we insert an IF condition block to compare the analog input value.
999,0,"Inside the if section, we add the servo control block and set the rotation."
1000,0,The 180° for the dark condition.
1001,0,"In the L section, we again add the servo block and set its rotation to 0° for the bright condition."
1002,0,"After completing the code and uploading it, we can test the system by covering the photo resistor with our hand or any object."
1003,0,"When the light decreases, the threshold is crossed."
1004,0,"And the servo rotates to 180°, closing the window."
1005,0,"When the cover is removed and the analog value becomes higher than the threshold, the servo moves back to 0°, opening the window again."
1006,0,"This automatic window system demonstrates an excellent real world application of sensors and actuators, showing how automation can improve."

1220,0,Art pattern using draw line blocks creating the beating effect.
1221,0,Once again we refresh the display and add a one second delay.
1222,0,These steps repeat continuously making the heart look like it is beating.
1223,0,Now let us move to the wiring diagram.
1224,0,The dot matrix display is connected to the board using DIN.
1225,0,CLK and CS pins along with power and ground.
1226,0,"After completing the wiring, we upload the program to the board."
1227,0,"Once uploaded, the dot matrix shows a red beating heart, confirming that the project is working successfully."
1228,0,Thank you for watching.
1229,0,Hello in this video we are going to create a project named Invasion alarm which is project 17 and this project helps us detect unwanted movement in a particular area and alert the user instantly.
1230,0,Let us start by opening the Wiz Robo application.
1231,0,On the screen now we click on Create New Project and select the board.
1232,0,Here we choose the board as was Inventor Kit.
1233,0,"After selecting the board, the programming interface opens."
1234,0,Now we move to the coding section.
1235,0,"First we drag the block when Arduino begin, which runs once when the board is powered on."
1236,0,Inside this block we add the serial begin block and set the baud rate to 9600 so that the Arduino can communicate with the serial monitor properly.
1237,0,This step is important for viewing.
1238,0,Output messages during testing.
1239,0,Next we add the forever loop which keeps running continuously.
1240,0,"Inside the forever loop, we place an if else condition to check the PIR motion sensor."
1241,0,"Here we use the read interface block, select IO5 as the pin and choose PIR motion sensor as the input device."
1242,0,"Now if motion is detected, the condition becomes true and the Arduino prints the message someone invaded on the serial monitor and also activates the LED and buzzer to give visual and sound alerts."
1243,0,"If motion is not detected, the condition becomes false and the Arduino prints no one on the serial monitor indicating the area is safe."
1244,0,We also add a weight of one second to keep the output stable and readable.
1245,0,Now let us move to the wiring diagram.
1246,0,"The air sensor VCC is connected to five volts, G&D to ground and the out pin to IO5."
1247,0,"The LED is connected with a resistor to a digital output pin and ground, and the buzzer is connected to another digital."
1248,0,Output pin and ground.
1249,0,After completing the wiring we upload the program.
1250,0,Now we open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600.
1251,0,When there is no movement it shows no one and when motion is detected it shows someone invaded confirming the invasion.
1252,0,Alarm system is working successfully.
1253,0,"Hello so today we will learn how project 16 time bomb works by understanding the code, wiring and output."
1254,0,In the code when the Arduino starts all button pins are set as input and the buzzer pin is set as output.
1255,0,The dot matrix display is initialized using the DIN and CLK pins.
1256,0,"Its brightness is adjusted, and a global variable is declared to store the countdown time inside the loop."
1257,0,The matrix display is continuously cleared and refreshed.
1258,0,Pressing the increase button raises the timer value while the decrease button lowers it and the updated value is shown on the TM1650 digital tube display.
1259,0,"When the start button is pressed, the countdown begins and the value decreases step by step."
1260,0,"During this process, the dot matrix shows ball related symbols and the buzzer."
1261,0,Turns on and off with delays to give warning beeps.
1262,0,"If the timer reaches 0, the buzzer sounds an alarm and the matrix displays an explosion style image."
1263,0,"A reset button allows the system to stop the alarm and return the timer to 0, and the code also ensures the value does not exceed its limit for wiring."
1264,0,All buttons are connected to their respective interface pins on the board with common power and ground.
1265,0,The dot matrix display is connected using its DIN and CLK pins along with VCC.
1266,0,G and the TM1650 digital tube display is connected through its data and clock lines to show the countdown clearly.
1267,0,The buzzer is connected to a digital output pin and ground so it can be controlled directly by the program as the output.
1268,0,"When the board is powered, the digital tube shows the set time."
1269,0,Ressing the buttons increases or decreases the value.
1270,0,"Once the countdown starts, the numbers reduce smoothly."
1271,0,The dot matrix displays animated bomb expressions and the.
1272,0,"Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor KITIN this project we are working with a programmable responder system."
1273,0,This system is used in quiz competitions and classrooms where students press buttons to answer questions.
1274,0,The system checks the responses using LED's.
1275,0,And helps improve students reaction time and attention.
1276,0,Now let us understand how the program works.
1277,0,We are simply understanding the logic behind the program.
1278,0,"First, several pins are configured."
1279,0,The following pins are set as input.
1280,0,IO16IO17IO18IO19 These pins are connected to the buttons.
1281,0,The following pins are set as output.
1282,0,IO12IO13IO14 IO 27.
1283,0,These pins are connected to the LED's that indicate the response result.
1284,0,Then a global variable named item is created and initialized with the value 0.
1285,0,This variable is used as a control flag for the system.
1286,0,"Now the program enters the forever loop, which keeps running continuously."
1287,0,"First, the LED on IO27 is turned on."
1288,0,This LED indicates that the system is ready to receive responses.
1289,0,Now the program checks if the button connected to ion 19 is pressed.
1290,0,The system starts the response round.
1291,0,"Once the round starts, all LEDs IO12IO13IO14 IO 27 are turned off."
1292,0,To clear any previous result dot.
1293,0,A short delay of 0.2 seconds is given.
1294,0,Now the program enters a loop that continues until item becomes one dot.
1295,0,This means the system will keep waiting until a valid response is received.
1296,0,"Inside this waiting loop, the program monitors three buttons."
1297,0,"If the button on IO18IS pressed, the LED on IO12 turns on and item is set to 1 dot."
1298,0,"If the button on IO17 is pressed, the LED on IO13 turns on, an item is set to 1 dot."
1299,0,"If the button on iOS 16 is pressed, the LED on IO14 turns on and item is set to 1 dot."
1300,0,After uploading the code as soon as any one of these.
1301,0,"Buttons as pressed, the value of item becomes one and the system stops checking further buttons."
1302,0,"This ensures that only the first response is accepted, just like in a real quiz competition."
1303,0,"Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit."
1304,0,This is the extended version of the Mini Lamp project.
1305,0,First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer.
1306,0,Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port.
1307,0,Once the kit is connected we can start.
1308,0,"Loading this project, we will control a lamp using a button."
1309,0,"When the button is pressed, the lamp will turn on."
1310,0,"When the button is released, the lamp will turn off."
1311,0,Now let us build the program step by step.
1312,0,First go to the event section and drag when Arduino began.
1313,0,Next go to the pin section and set IO4AS output for the lamp.
1314,0,LED IO15 as input for the button.
1315,0,Now go to the control section and add the forever block.
1316,0,Inside the forever block add an if else statement for the condition choose interface IO15 button will be pushed.
1317,0,"If this condition is true, it means the button is pressed besso inside the if part addled pin IO4 out hi GH."
1318,0,This turns the lamp on to I and the else part addled pin IO4 out LW.
1319,0,This turns the lamp off when the button is not pressed.
1320,0,Now upload the program to the Wiz inventor kit.
1321,0,"After uploading press the button, the lamp turns on."
1322,0,"Release the button, the lamp turns off."
1323,0,"So in this extended version of the Mini Lamp project, we learned how to use conditional logic to control a device using a button."
1324,0,Thank you for watching.
1325,0,---------Inventer-kit-video 9 -----------
1326,0,"Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit."
1327,0,This is project 14 counter.
1328,0,In this project we have already written the program and now we are simply going to understand how the code works this counter.
1329,0,And count from zero to 9999 using three buttons.
1330,0,"1 button is used to increase the number, one is used to decrease the number and one is used to reset the counter."
1331,0,The value is shown on a 4 digit digital display.
1332,0,Let us understand the logic of the program.
1333,0,First 3 pins are configured as input IO17IO18 and IO19.
1334,0,These are connected to the three buttons.
1335,0,Then a global variable named item is created.
1336,0,This variable stores the current number that we see on the display.
1337,0,Now the program enters the forever loop.
1338,0,Which keeps running continuously.
1339,0,"Inside this loop, the program checks each button."
1340,0,"If the button on IO19 is pressed, the value of item increases by one."
1341,0,"If the button on IO18IS pressed, the value of item decreases by 1."
1342,0,"If the button on IO17 is pressed, the value of item is reset to 0."
1343,0,After this the program checks one important condition.
1344,0,"If the value becomes greater than 9999, it is automatically set back to 0."
1345,0,This keeps the number within the range of the four digit display finally.
1346,0,The updated value of item is sent to the display using the TM1650 display block and a small delay of 0.2 seconds is added so that the counting remains smooth and readable.
1347,0,"So the program continuously listens to the buttons, updates the number and refreshes the display."
1348,0,This is how the counter works.
1349,0,Now upload the program to the Wise Inventor Kit.
1350,0,"After uploading, press IO19 button, the number increases, ress IO18 button, the number decreases, press IO17 button, the counter resets."
1351,0,The display always stays between 0 and 9999.
1352,0,"So in this project we learned how to create a multifunction digital counter using buttons, variables and display control."
1353,0,"Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit."
1354,0,This is Project 13 Mini lamp.

1358,0,I end this project.
1359,0,We will control a lamp using a button and observe the button status using the serial monitor.
1360,0,Now let us understand the working principle.
1361,0,"When the button is not pressed, voltage from VCC passes through a resistor and provides a high signal to the input pin."
1362,0,"When the button is pressed, the pin is connected to G&D producing."
1363,0,Low signal the resistor prevents a short circuit between VCC and GND.
1364,0,Now let us build the program.

1372,0,Then add another serial block and choose Print the state value of button in interface IO15 in wrap mode.
1373,0,Now upload the program to the Wiz Inventor kit.
1374,0,After uploading open the serial monitor and set the baud rate.
1375,0,"The 96-O dot when you press the button, the serial monitor will display key status 0."
1376,0,"When you release the button, it will display key status once."
1377,0,"So in this project we learned how to read a button input, understand its logic level."

2433,0,This project helps us understand.
2434,0,Wireless communication and real time data monitoring.

2444,0,Congratulations.
2445,0,You have successfully built a Bluetooth temperature monitoring system.
2446,0,"Keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep building with Wise Robo."
2447,0,Now I will explain how this program works step by step.
2448,0,"When the Arduino starts, it first opens serial communication at 9600 baud rate."
2449,0,Then the OLED display is initialized and cleared so it is ready to show.
2450,0,Symbols.
2451,0,"The IR receiver is also initialized on pin 6 and both servos are set to their starting positions, so the crane is in a stable state."
2452,0,"Inside the forever loop, the Arduino keeps checking if any data is received from the IR remote."
2453,0,"Whenever a button is pressed, the IR receiver reads the hex value of that button and refreshes for the next command."
2454,0,Each hex value is linked to a specific action.
2455,0,"For example, when 1 button is pressed, the OLED shows a symbol and a servo on pin 13 rotates slightly to move the crane left or right."
2456,0,Another button makes the servo rotate in the opposite direction.
2457,0,"When the up button is pressed, the servo on pin 12 moves to raise the object and when the down button is pressed, the servo moves back to lower the object."
2458,0,"At the same time, the OLED display updates to show arrows or icons so we can visually understand what action the crane is performing."
2459,0,"This project helps us learn how IR remote communication works, how different inputs can control motors"
2459,1,", how different inputs can control motors, and how multiple components like servos and OLED displays can work together to create a smart machine."
2460,0,In this project we create an automatic CSI using a Control Board and a servo motor.
2461,0,"A seesaw normally moves up and down when children push with their feet, but here the movement is controlled electronically."
2462,0,"The servo motor is connected to pin 13 of the main board, with its power and ground properly connected."
2463,0,"When the program starts, the board sends angle and delay commands to the servo motor."
2464,0,"By changing the angle value, the servo rotates in a specific direction and speed, which makes one side of the seesaw rise while the other side falls."
2465,0,"An angle close to 90 slows or stops the rotation, while values lower or higher than 90 control the direction and speed."
2466,0,"With the added delay, the motion becomes smooth and continuous, giving the seesaw A realistic up and down movement."
2467,0,"This project helps students understand how servo motors work, how angles control motion, and how simple coding can automate mechanical movements in real life models."
2468,0,"This rope skipping machine uses a joystick module, a 360° servo motor, and a passive buzzer to create an automatic skipping system."
2469,0,The joystick works using I2C communication and provides 2 analog values X&Y ranging from zero to 1023 along with a digital button output in the neutral position.
2470,0,Both X&Y values are around 512.
2471,0,The 360° servo motor is connected to pin D13.
2472,0,And is controlled by changing its angle value.
2473,0,"When the servo angle is set to 90°, the motor stops rotating."
2474,0,"If the angle is less than 90°, the servo rotates in One Direction and if it is greater than 90° it rotates in the opposite direction."
2475,0,"By changing how far the value is from 90°, the speed of rotation can be increased or decreased."
2476,0,"In the program, the joystick values are continuously read inside a loop."
2477,0,"If the X axis value is greater than 512, the rope rotates in One Direction."
2478,0,"If it is less than 512, the rope rotates in the opposite direction."
2479,0,This allows the skipping direction and speed to be controlled smoothly using the joystick.
2480,0,"When the joystick button is pressed, the passive buzzer plays a sound giving audio feedback to the user."
2481,0,This.
2482,0,Characters to life by coding your own animations.
2483,0,"Make them jump, talk, fly, or anything else you can imagine."
2484,0,"To start, let's have our character say something."
2485,0,I'll have her say hello friends.
2486,0,Click the block to see what it does.
2487,0,Let's have this code run when we hit the green flag.
2488,0,You can also animate a character by switching costumes.
2489,0,I'll grab the next costume block.
2490,0,Let's add a play sound block.
2491,0,We can have the code run when we click the Sprite.
2492,0,I'll grab the when Sprite clicked block.
2493,0,Let's start to code another character.
2494,0,I'll select JP.
2495,0,"Once I've clicked on JP, I'll be adding code for JP."
2496,0,Maybe we can make JP grow and shrink.
2497,0,You can make a character get bigger by changing the size.
2498,0,And get smaller by typing a -Let's put this change size by 10 block in a repeat loop.
2499,0,This makes the character grow gradually.
2500,0,We can put the change size by -10 block in a repeat loop too.
2501,0,And I'll add a sound.
2502,0,Now let's also have this code run when we click this Sprite.
2503,0,Yeah.
2504,0,Click the green arrow for more ideas.
2505,0,What will you create?
2506,0,With Scratch you can animate an adventure game.
2507,0,I want Garnet to be my main character.
2508,0,You can pick any one you want and if you can't see your character.
2509,0,Click on their icon and you can make them show up or hide by clicking these buttons on and off.
2510,0,Click on the icon of your character and now you can program them to do things in Scratch.
2511,0,You drag out blocks of code from here to make programs here which will make things happen here on the stage.
2512,0,Now let's make our game.
2513,0,"As you watch, you can pause the video and try each step."
2514,0,First try going to the looks category and dragging out a save block to make your character say something.
2515,0,Now I want to make my character follow the mouse so that I can move her around the screen.
2516,0,"To do this, go to the motion category, drag out the block that says Glide 1 seconds to random position and choose mouse pointer from the menu."
2517,0,Attach this block under the say block and let's see what happens.
2518,0,Cool.
2519,0,She talked and then went to my mouse pointer.
2520,0,But we want our main character to always follow our mouse pointer.
2521,0,"To do this, try dragging out a loop from the control category."
2522,0,"When you put code in a loop, that code will happen over and over again."
2523,0,"Awesome, now we can move our character with the mouse pointer."
2524,0,You can put in a smaller number like .3 if you want your character to move faster.
2525,0,Let's attach this loop back under the save block and put a when green flag clicked block on top and now we can start the game by clicking the green flag.
2526,0,Now let's make our character collect items.
2527,0,Click on the icon of the item you want and now you can program the item.
2528,0,Make sure you click show to make your item show up.
2529,0,What should we make the item do?
2530,0,"I think that when Garnet catches the gem, I want it to play a sound and then go to a new random place to do this."
2531,0,Go to the control category and drag out a Wait until block.
2532,0,Go to the sensing category and grab the block that says Touching mouse pointer and choose your main character from the menu.
2533,0,"My main character is Garnet, so I'll choose Garnet, but if Finn was your main character, you'd choose Finn."
2534,0,And put that block inside the wait until block.
2535,0,Add a start sound block to make it play a sound and then add a go to random position block to make it go to a random place.
2536,0,And let's add a green flag block on top.
2537,0,There we go.
2538,0,"The gem waits until Garnet touches it, then plays a sound and goes to a new place."
2539,0,"But I want it to do this over and over again, so try dragging out another forever loop and putting the code inside."
2540,0,"Awesome, we've got a game going."
2541,0,"Finally, let's add a score."
2542,0,"To do this, go to the variables category and create a variable called score or whatever you want to call it."
2543,0,Try dragging out a change variable block and choosing score.
2544,0,"And if you put this code inside the loop, the score will increase every time your character catches the item."
2545,0,And let's reset the score to 0 when the game is restarted.
2546,0,Click the green arrow to see each step and to find out how to add more levels.
2547,0,You can use Scratch to make a chase game.
2548,0,"To start, let's pick a backdrop."
2549,0,Now let's pick a Sprite.
2550,0,I'll choose the octopus.
2551,0,Let's make it move when I press the arrow keys.
2552,0,"When I press the right arrow key, we can make it move right?"
2553,0,And left arrow to move left.
2554,0,Let's add a Sprite to chase.
2555,0,I'll choose this star.
2556,0,Let's make this bright move around randomly.
2557,0,Click the green arrow to see this code and to see what else you might add to your game.
2558,0,"You can use Scratch to tell a story, create a conversation, switch scenes, or do whatever else you can imagine to get started."
2559,0,Let's pick a background.
2560,0,I'll go with the Witch House now.
2561,0,Let's pick a Sprite.
2562,0,I'll pick the wizard.
2563,0,Let's have our character say something.
2564,0,I'll have my character say welcome to magic school.
2565,0,"I'd like to add another character, so I'll choose another Sprite."
2566,0,This time I'll pick the elf.
2567,0,"It looks like the elf isn't facing the wizard, so I'll change the way they're looking."
2568,0,Let's go to the costume tab and choose Flip Horizontal.
2569,0,So the costume is now flipped to face the wizard.
2570,0,Let's make a conversation.
2571,0,I'll add a save block to the elf Sprite.
2572,0,I'll make this character say I'm going on a quest.
2573,0,Let's click the green flag to see what happens.
2574,0,"They both speak at the same time, so let's go ahead and add a weight block before the elf speaks."
2575,0,I'll make this 2 seconds.
2576,0,Let's have the characters change scenes.
2577,0,I'll add another background.
2578,0,This time I'll choose Mountain.
2579,0,I'll reselect the ELF Sprite and go back to the coating area.
2580,0,Let's have the characters start at the witch house.
2581,0,"Wait 4 seconds, which is how long the conversation is."
2582,0,And then switched to the mountain backdrop.
2583,0,"Finally, what if we don't want the wizard to be in the mountain scene?"
2584,0,Let's go back to the wizard Sprite and add a when backdrop switches to block.
2585,0,I'll set it to mountain and make the wizard hide.
2586,0,Let's try it out.
2587,0,Looks good.
2588,0,Now let's replay the project.
2589,0,The wizard doesn't show up at all.
2590,0,That's because we've hidden it.
2591,0,"So what we'll need to do is add a show block at the top of the script so that whenever someone replays the project, the wizard will show first."
2592,0,Click the green arrow to see this code again and explore what else you might add to your story.
2593,0,"You can use your webcam to interact with your Scratch projects, PETA, virtual animal pop balloons, or anything else you can imagine."
2594,0,"To start, let's add the video sensing extension."
2595,0,"So as you can see, it turns on our webcam and gives us a new set of blocks to play with."
2596,0,Let's start by making a simple project where we pet the cat.
2597,0,I'll grab the win.
2598,0,Video motion is greater than 10 block.
2599,0,So the way this block works is it's measuring the amount of motion that happens underneath the Sprite and it's measured.
2600,0,"On a scale of zero to 100, so 0 is no movement and 100th as much movement as we can do, let's go ahead and stick with the default value of 10."
2601,0,"So next I'll grab a play sound until done, block and attach it."
2602,0,So let's give it a shot.
2603,0,Maybe we'll try a higher value like 95 just to see what happens.
2604,0,"OK, so nothing's happening."
2605,0,"Really, really have to do a lot of motion."
2606,0,"So maybe, maybe we go back to 10."
2607,0,"Cool, I can't wait to see what you do with video sensing."
2608,0,You can make a character fly.
2609,0,It could be anyone flying anywhere.
2610,0,Start by choosing a character to fly with.
2611,0,"Next, let's pick something to fly past."
2612,0,It can be anything.
2613,0,I'll pick buildings.
2614,0,"To make our character look like it's moving, we can move the scenery behind it."
2615,0,Let's use change acts to move the building across the screen.
2616,0,Let's try a negative number to make it look like it's going past it.
2617,0,Let's make it repeat.
2618,0,Perhaps 50 times.
2619,0,Let's have our building start all the way to the right.
2620,0,We can use set X.
2621,0,"0 is going to be in the middle, so let's try a higher number."
2622,0,I'll try 250.
2623,0,Let's have it keep going forever.
2624,0,We can start this script by pressing the green flag.
2625,0,"To learn how to make your character move with arrow keys, add a score or fly with a crew, click the green arrow."
2626,0,"Hi everyone, welcome back to the podcast club."
2627,0,And as you all remember last time or we had done and that was all about how to create your own creative titles for the podcast using headline creator said to day we're going to be moving on to another
2627,1,to day we're going to be moving on to another website
2627,2,", another mode of the podcast."
2628,0,It's called Zen caster.com Zed.
2629,0,Dr.com and this is the platform where we will be recording our podcasts in the studio quality like we have recording studios basically then cast as a platform that provides you with high quality of
2629,1,a platform that provides you with high quality of podcasting recording.
2630,0,So you have to come to this website.
2631,0,"Make your own account and if you haven't signed up, simply click upon tries and caster for free to make your account and then you have to enter your first name, your last name, user name"
2631,1,", your last name, user name, e-mail and password and then sign up."
2632,0,That's all you have to do and make sure you always.
2633,0,Do it under the guidance of your parents so that they know on which websites you're making the accounts and if you already have an account that you will have after signing up
2633,1,", you have to go and click upon login."
2634,0,"And after you've logged in, that's how your screen would look like."
2635,0,But you won't be able to see any episodes here 'cause these are all like my recordings.
2636,0,"But for you, it will be empty if this is that's the first time you're signing in, or the 1st, or if you haven't even made an episode."
2637,0,"So for Zen Caster, he basically can create an episode to start a podcast."
2638,0,"Recording backing upon creating episode, but this will be done a little bit later."
2639,0,For now we are only by understanding the basics.
2640,0,"So in this, what a good feature about recording with Zen Caster is that the audio quality comes better even if you are facing network issues still."
2641,0,The voice is crystal clear.
2642,0,Like I love that about Zen Caster.
2643,0,"When it comes to the video quality in Zen Caster, when you're recording and see, when you record with video as well and you want to post it on YouTube or anywhere else, the video quality is perfect."
2644,0,"It's like 1080 pixels now, the normal 720 pixels."
2645,0,Then you have that you have like when your zoom or teams but here it has 1080 pixels and that's way better than normal camera quality.
2646,0,That's why people say it's a port.
2647,0,Proper pseudo recording way of podcasting.
2648,0,"So if you see your episodes, all of them that you record here will be saved and you will also delete them."
2649,0,"If you want after you've recorded, but then they won't be permanently deleted."
2650,0,They will only be like archived in a way give me and you know what I mean.
2651,0,"They'll just be removed from displaying in the dashboard, but it will be there in your like, you know, Dropbox the card as well or your Google Drive if you want to connect it."
2652,0,"Then you have like credits, but you don't need to add any post production credits because it's just you doing it."
2653,0,"That's just when you have like you know anybody working for the post production and you want to give credence to the person, then you can put that here, but there's no need."
2654,0,Then we have connected to cloud drives.
2655,0,I just talked about that.
2656,0,"Whatever records that you would record would automatically be sent to Dropbox or Google Drive, and then you can see your account here."
2657,0,"If you have to check any illness, see what is your user info and I'll still be able to see how much you've been doing or how active you are."
2658,0,And then if you do and you pay for getting more space but like I don't think you would need to pay because it already provides you with 35 GB space.
2659,0,And that's too like you know much because it won't take much space for you when you're recording your episodes.
2660,0,And then you have like log out.
2661,0,"If you want to log out from here, you can also go ahead and check out these blog Falls Ancaster, where they provide you with lots of, you know, info about."
2662,0,"Our podcasting is done and then basically what is podcast guest forms, what will how to release them just about like basic guards about using podcasts, I mean Zen Caster then you have like support."
2663,0,"So if you are facing some issues, you can always go and go to supportcertaincast.com."
2664,0,And you can always go have checked the articles from here and you can also use the chat bot here to write your questions.
2665,0,"And if you have any questions, they would reply and 30 minutes to you."
2666,0,So that's our basics of Zen Caster.
2667,0,All I wanted to do was right now to understand what's Ancaster.
2668,0,And make sure that you have an account ready in the class itself.
2669,0,You can only use.
2670,0,"Go ahead, get the computer and then make an account."
2671,0,And then I'll meet you at the next class.
2672,0,We'll be understanding how to create an episode.
2673,0,Thank you.
2674,0,Have a nice day.
2675,0,"Hi everyone, welcome to another class of the podcast club."
2676,0,"And as you remember, last time we had learned about how to create an anchor account and what are the features is anchor."
2677,0,"So after setting up all of the things to day, we'll be learning how you can create."
2678,0,Their own podcast title.
2679,0,And for that you have to search for course schedule decom headline Analyzer or if you just search headline analyzer on Google
2679,1,", the first website that you would get in the description would be go schedule.com."
2680,0,You have to click upon that and it will open up the website.
2681,0,So you have to create an account as well on this website.
2682,0,"So when you type your headline here, as you can see it will ask you to make an account."
2683,0,But before that what exactly is headline analyzer?
2684,0,So here you can create.
2685,0,"Their own creative headlines and whatever you have thought, you can type it in here and then it will give you the percentage of how much accurate or how much creative"
2685,1,", how much are powerful your headline is."
2686,0,"So if your headline comes above 50%, it's good to go."
2687,0,But we can always.
2688,0,Improve ourselves and I'll be putting in my headline here right now and then we'll see what all the features the headline headline analyzer provides us with.
2689,0,So let me quickly type the podcast name of my podcast.
2690,0,Each one teach 10-and amazing.
2691,0,World of STEM and then you have to click upon analyze now and then you have to create an account.
2692,0,"So you just have to get the full name, e-mail ID, company name."
2693,0,I don't think this is required but so you can add any company name here or if you have any company website URL.
2694,0,So you can put that here and then also add the password.
2695,0,"After you have entered all the credentials, it will open up the account that you have just made and then it shows the headline score."
2696,0,"So it gives me a 57, a headline score out of 100."
2697,0,"That is a good score, not that bad, but like it doesn't always mean that you have to get."
2698,0,"100 and 100 score, it depends upon how how the headline has to work according to you."
2699,0,So it gives me a headline score of 57 out of which it gives me suggestions as well like you.
2700,0,In increase more emotional words you can decrease more common words you can increase the word count partly.
2701,0,3 words and then you could rephrase your sentences.
2702,0,So here it shows me that each one each turn and then this means a common word.
2703,0,As you can see a thick this is a powerful word amazing an uncommon is world.
2704,0,Then we have again a common word and strength so.
2705,0,"First of all I hashtag it, did not realize what exactly it is so that might be a problem."
2706,0,"And many of them don't know what stem is, so just took it as a noun here and it has given me more description of how I could decrease the common words."
2707,0,How how much is the limit for the uncommon?
2708,0,Words and here it says 0% for emotional.
2709,0,So that means I could add more emotional words here and then I have one power words.
2710,0,If I want I can add more.
2711,0,"And then here it says that you can add a few more words to grab attention, but I believe that if it is too long it would actually take away the attention."
2712,0,So it should be around like 5 words.
2713,0,5 to 6 words is perfectly alright and mine is about 12345.
2714,0,Exciting 6 was good to go.
2715,0,Don't go beyond 6 words because that becomes too lengthy.
2716,0,Then it says 43.
2717,0,Can't pick count um.
2718,0,"Our 50 to 60 character counts is OK, but not more than that."
2719,0,And then it says what is reading grade level.
2720,0,It gives the sentiment how people would take this as it gives me a positive sentiment and then I'm also able to see if I'm if I have the.
2721,0,Ability to scheme this or not.
2722,0,"So if I have to skim a path that means cut out a part, it will show me that which part could be skimmed."
2723,0,So it says amazing and world.
2724,0,So actually it is not very necessary that you have to do all of them.
2725,0,"But if you want to try it out, you can always do that."
2726,0,And that's exactly the headline scored that you would try on your own in the SEO's core.
2727,0,It basically gives you the quality of your arm headline.
2728,0,It gives me an 88% high quality.
2729,0,It shows how many keywords do you have and it will also shows.
2730,0,"That OHH, would it be visible to the audience when they would search it as a website or what is the score when it comes to 1 to 8?"
2731,0,And it gives me a score between  to .
2732,0,So that is good.
2733,0,And also you can see that how you could increase your limit here.
2734,0,So that means if it's 54 then.
2735,0,That could increase to 5860 and it gives you also more and more inspiration to make your headline better.
2736,0,So that was all about what exactly Headliner is and I wish that you all try this thing because it will help you to make your podcast headlines better.
2737,0,And I'm sure by that by now you already have thought what your podcast would be about.
2738,0,So let's get ready and let's get get up and start creating our headlines and our podcast titles and use headliner to make it better.
2739,0,So thank you so much.
2740,0,See you in the next class Bye.
2741,0,"Hi everyone, today we'll be learning about how to use Anchor and for that we have to  go ahead search for anchor.fm"
2741,1,". So this is a website that's an easiest way to make,  create, distribute and multihouse your podcast all for free"
2741,2,. You don't need to pay at all to get  started for signing in into this website and it automatically links to lots of other platforms as  well where people can listen to your podcast
2741,3,. In this video we'll be learning just about the  basics of anchor and what are the features of anchor.
2742,0,So first of all if you don't have an  account on anchor we have to come here to this top right corner and we have this yellow icon of sign  up
2742,1,". Click upon that and then it asks you for your full name, your email id and password. So these  are the credentials that you have to fill on your own."
2743,0,Just for the date of birth you have to make  sure that it is above the age of 18 that means if you are putting an age of 16 so you won't be able  to make an account on anchor and it is important that
2743,1,an account on anchor and it is important that if you are under the age of 18 and you're  making an account then it should be under the guidance of your parents and they should know  that you made an
2743,2,parents and they should know  that you made an account here
2743,3,. They should know the email id and password
2743,4,". So put in your month, day, year  and it should be that the year that you put in should be like it is telling you above the age of  18 and then I'm not a robot sign up."
2744,0,If you already have an account you can click upon sign in and then  enter your email id and password
2744,1,. So after you're signed in you'll be able to see your dashboard  but the only difference it is that if you have signed up for the first time it wouldn't look like  this
2744,2,". It'll be like you have to complete a few steps of making your podcast name, description,  create a cover art and many other things."
2745,0,So for now let me just quickly explain you all the features  of the anchor website. So the first thing we have here is your podcast description. So this icon  here means edit.
2746,0,So under that you can give your podcast a name like I have given  hashtag each one teach 10 and amazing world of 10. Under that we have a podcast description
2746,1,.  So this is really important that we're giving a description it should be strong enough  and it should be catchy enough to attract people and so is for the podcast name.
2747,0,If it is too long  or too short it won't attract people to your podcast
2747,1,. But if it is a medium number of letters  and characters such as a 43 and 507 that's good to go but it should have good quality of information  as well. Then you have your cover art.
2748,0,So this can be made through different softwares like Canva
2748,1,",  Adobe Spark and many other and then you can either download the art and also update it if  you don't want to change if you don't like it and you want to change this you click upon update  cover art"
2748,2,. Then we have podcast category
2748,3,". So there's lots of categories that we have such as books,  design, performing arts, we have how to, we have crafts, we have astronomy, we have film history,  TV reviews and many other."
2749,0,"So I have chosen education because my podcast is about STEM,  game based learning and many things that can be done in the classroom for better engagement"
2749,1,". So  that's why I've chosen the podcast category of education. Then we have content, clean or explicit."
2750,0,So clean means it is available for everybody or explicit means that only a certain group of age  can hear to that podcast. Then we have show anchor logo and cover art
2750,1,. Then we have show anchor logo and cover art. So I haven't enabled that  I just want my people to see only my cover art and not the anchor logo so you can turn that off  from here.
2751,0,Then we have show voice messages button on your anchor profile
2751,1,. So this means that if I go  to the anchor profile I'll be able to see a show voice button there where people can record messages  to me and send that to me
2751,2,. Just like in YouTube we have the comment section similarly in anchor  profile we have voice messages.
2752,0,Then we can also include them in our podcast descriptions.  So that means if I have used one of the voice messages in my podcast then it automatically  will be added in the description
2752,1,. Next we have podcast language.
2753,0,So we can choose from any  language. I have chosen English. You can choose whatever appeals to you the most.
2754,0,Then we have  the account settings. Under that we have the display name that is your name. Then you have  the email ID your website and then you can also give your anchor custom URL.
2755,0,So this means that  if you have google.com slash and then you're searching something so you can see I've got a  FM slash dashboard that podcast that edit
2755,1,. Similarly I have made my own URL anchor.fm  slash wonder Namya. It cannot be more than 25 characters.
2756,0,So make sure that you have it as  small as possible. Then you can also add your own connections. If you don't have any accounts  that's OK.
2757,0,I've added my Twitter account Instagram and YouTube. You can also go ahead add your own  connections if you want
2757,1,. And yeah that's all about the podcast settings that we have and  hope you're clear about what exactly a podcast is.
2758,0,So if you haven't saved the changes then you  should always click upon save. Otherwise just cancel them if you don't want to save it
2758,1,. So then  if you scroll down you can also see number of plays you've had in the entire time of your podcast  and what was the estimated audience based on the recent episodes who are your unique
2758,2,based on the recent episodes who are your unique listeners and  it also shows the current balance.
2759,0,So for now I believe the current balance only works in Canada  and United States. But I guess they're trying to come to other countries as well. Next it shows  the podcast performance.
2760,0,You can always alter that to daily weekly and monthly. Then we have the top  episodes. How many views we've got.
2761,0,And I believe that the first episode always gets the most views.  That's a fact. Then we have your listeners.
2762,0,"So it shows the exact geographic location. If I go  under India I can see from Punjab, from Tamil Nadu, from Odisha, Assam and many other"
2762,1,". Then we have  from United States we have Indiana, New Jersey, Georgia, New Hampshire, Illinois and many other."
2763,0,And then all of the countries who have been listening to you
2763,1,". Then the listening platforms  like we have Anchor, Apple Podcasts, web browser is what I'm using right now, Spotify and other  are like you know Radio FM and many other. Then the devices."
2764,0,"It shows you like people are  listening from web, iPhone, Android, Windows and other devices as well. It shows the gender of people  male, female, not specified, non-binary"
2764,1,. And then we also have the ages of people.
2765,0,And then the source  is always from Spotify but not for listening platforms because here Spotify itself comes  in a listening platform
2765,1,. So that's all about the podcast performance and how people are listening  to you. And then we can always go ahead and see the podcast availability if we come under the  settings option.
2766,0,"Under that you can see it automatically links to all the platforms.  So once you've uploaded the first episode on Anchor, it automatically links your podcast  on Spotify for free"
2766,1,". And other platforms are Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Amazon Music,  Castbox, Pocketcast, Radio Public and Stitcher."
2767,0,So that's all that you need to know for today on  what exactly a podcast is and how does the Anchor setup looks like
2767,1,. In the next one we'll be learning  about how to make your podcast title description and what makes that catchy. So I hope you enjoyed  the video.
2768,0,Thank you so much. Have a nice day.
2769,0,"Hello students, welcome to another video and here we will be starting with our new project."
2770,0,"So I'm thinking of something like a student login application, just where people log in and just get the information they want."
2771,0,"So we'll be working on a very simple app, much simpler actually, so let's just make it."
2772,0,Login page first.
2773,0,"So I have some ideas for the login page, so let's just get started."
2774,0,I've imported a few images right here.
2775,0,This is for the background so.
2776,0,Let me just adjust it here.
2777,0,"OK, hope it looks nice."
2778,0,I I should just.
2779,0,Increase the size.
2780,0,"OK, I think this looks fine now."
2781,0,Let's constrain this important.
2782,0,And there you go.
2783,0,Now let's import another image.
2784,0,Initially I was just looking for a rectangle with rounded edges.
2785,0,I just couldn't find it so.
2786,0,"And I didn't wanna work hard to find that, so here we are with the regular rectangle anyways, so let's work with this."
2787,0,I hope it looks fine.
2788,0,"It looks fine, though."
2789,0,Yeah.
2790,0,So now we want some text to be entered.
2791,0,"We'll be using this one right here, the third one."
2792,0,And.
2793,0,Let's give it a hint.
2794,0,"You're supposed to give it a hint, so it should be enter your username."
2795,0,So I want the user to enter their username.
2796,0,"So it looks something like this, I think pretty OK, sufficiently OK, looks fine and."
2797,0,Then we'll let's constrain this as well.
2798,0,So we should constraint it here.
2799,0,And the other one would go somewhere.
2800,0,Here.
2801,0,And we will move it a little up.
2802,0,Did I mess up?
2803,0,No.
2804,0,OK.
2805,0,I think it looks fine here.
2806,0,Now we'll copy this and paste it here itself.
2807,0,"We have another one, we'll just adjust it a bit here."
2808,0,Here we will be using Enter.
2809,0,Your.
2810,0,Password.
2811,0,So we have two.
2812,0,Fields.
2813,0,She just.
2814,0,"Yeah, and now we need the login button of course, so."
2815,0,And the text would be different.
2816,0,Of course we want it to be.
2817,0,"I don't know what keys I pressed anyway, so."
2818,0,OK text.
2819,0,There we have it.
2820,0,Login.
2821,0,And we need to change The Color Purple.
2822,0,"Button here looks like we don't have any taste, no good taste."
2823,0,So we'll just change that.
2824,0,"So changing it to black, for that you will be needing this background."
2825,0,We'll change the background to black.
2826,0,I think it should be like 0.
2827,0,"If you wanted like pure black, the hashes would be this."
2828,0,And there we have it.
2829,0,I think I'll just.
2830,0,Increase the length.
2831,0,OK.
2832,0,I think our page looks fine now.
2833,0,"You can also add the forgot password and all those things here, but we'll keep it simple for now."
2834,0,So this would be our GUI.
2835,0,"We can also remove the borders, though I think I would."
2836,0,It must be called outline I guess.
2837,0,"No, we'll have to change the style."
2838,0,Probably.
2839,0,So let's change that.
2840,0,"Not horizontally constrained, so let's just constrain that horizontally as well."
2841,0,OK.
2842,0,Now.
2843,0,That's OK.
2844,0,"That wasn't, that wasn't really a border."
2845,0,It was simply like just because we have selected the element anyways.
2846,0,So we have some issues here.
2847,0,We'll sort those out first.
2848,0,It says content description for the image is missing.
2849,0,"Yes, we need to add the image content description."
2850,0,You can.
2851,0,We'll just switch to a code and do it.
2852,0,So.
2853,0,Image we need to add the content description.
2854,0,This one is the background image.
2855,0,So I had it hardcoded already.
2856,0,And then we made this Alice call it a rectangle just for the sake of.
2857,0,What writing so?
2858,0,It's hardcoded this as well.
2859,0,Let's have a look at any other problems that we might have.
2860,0,"The view isn't constrained the button, we have not constrained it yet, so let's do that as well."
2861,0,So you might forget a lot of things and then it will remind you that you didn't do that.
2862,0,So now.
2863,0,Get it done.
2864,0,OK.
2865,0,Constrained.
2866,0,Then we need to hard code a lot of strings.
2867,0,Missing autofill.
2868,0,Hints.
2869,0,"OK, we don't want to auto fill this though it will display those dots dots dots."
2870,0,"I mean, so we'll just let it go for now."
2871,0,We'll although we'll hardcode these strings here.
2872,0,So let's just hard code these.
2873,0,"Yeah, we get it by now."
2874,0,"We have done this a lot, so log in as well."
2875,0,So there we go.
2876,0,I don't think we have many problems here.
2877,0,So it says something is too small.
2878,0,Fix it.
2879,0,Change the height so it's just giving us suggestions that what could be wrong.
2880,0,So we are just adjusting the size automatically.
2881,0,We'll just let it adjust.
2882,0,So.
2883,0,"Um, color contrast."
2884,0,"Well, we like it like that, so it's fine."
2885,0,"So yes, there will be a lot of suggestions that will get you where you can follow it or not."
2886,0,That's fine.
2887,0,"Now this is our GUI, so that would be it for this video we made the GUI and in the next one we will be logging in and we'll be just checking the username and password that's entered by the user."
2888,0,And act accordingly.
2889,0,So let's see.
2890,0,"Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is."
2891,0,Actually.
2892,0,Now we have this simple GUI right here.
2893,0,"We have a text, it has an ID."
2894,0,Each one of these has an ID.
2895,0,So we have a background image.
2896,0,We won't be.
2897,0,You know changing anything regarding that.
2898,0,"We have a hide button, we have a page one text."
2899,0,The ID has been this.
2900,0,Now we'll be setting up the on click listener.
2901,0,It would work similar to onclick attribute.
2902,0,Now this is an attribute.
2903,0,If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist.
2904,0,Well it is used.
2905,0,We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform.
2906,0,So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore.
2907,0,The reason being that.
2908,0,"It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now."
2909,0,Because it is.
2910,0,It works for the older versions even here.
2911,0,We tried using it and it works very much fine.
2912,0,But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method.
2913,0,"It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that."
2914,0,"And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute."
2915,0,That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML.
2916,0,"Anyways, so we have this page."
2917,0,Let me just make another.
2918,0,Let me make a few changes.
2919,0,Let me just select the hide button and here.
2920,0,"On click, I'll make sure it's empty."
2921,0,We do not have anything.
2922,0,"OK, it's blank."
2923,0,I have erased anything that was here.
2924,0,This is the basic simple code.
2925,0,Let me just.
2926,0,Change the text right here.
2927,0,Let me just simply search for text.
2928,0,Let's call it Click.
2929,0,Me.
2930,0,So this is the text.
2931,0,We'll have to hardcode this as well.
2932,0,Let's just hardcode it.
2933,0,There you see it.
2934,0,So we hard coded it now.
2935,0,Let's add another button.
2936,0,We'll just copy this one.
2937,0,And paste it here itself.
2938,0,Move it.
2939,0,Up.
2940,0,I hope I have put it in between the text.
2941,0,OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
2942,0,Let me call it.
2943,0,Let me give these a different ID.
2944,0,Top button.
2945,0,This would be called the bottom button.
2946,0,Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here.
2947,0,"OK, so now we have added two buttons."
2948,0,Here we have a text in between.
2949,0,And now the real thing will start.
2950,0,So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables.
2951,0,"We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it."
2952,0,Make sure each one of them has an ID.
2953,0,So all of them have an ID.
2954,0,Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
2955,0,Will be declaring it below here.
2956,0,"You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public."
2957,0,I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
2958,0,I want to declare the.
2959,0,"Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that."
2960,0,You use the.
2961,0,You consider the ID and the name.
2962,0,The variable name here as different.
2963,0,"You can give it the same name, but they are different, so."
2964,0,We are declaring the top button.
2965,0,And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
2966,0,Use the button top button dot set.
2967,0,On click listener.
2968,0,Now this right here is very important.
2969,0,You need to.
2970,0,Use this name right here and set onclick listener.
2971,0,What it will do.
2972,0,What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button.
2973,0,"Whenever you click it, it will take an action."
2974,0,Then in the bracket you will write.
2975,0,New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this.
2976,0,Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens.
2977,0,So let me declare the text here as well.
2978,0,Let me call it text equal to.
2979,0,And there we have the text as well.
2980,0,"Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text."
2981,0,Dot.
2982,0,Set.
2983,0,Text.
2984,0,"OK, I was typing it wrong."
2985,0,Type the set text.
2986,0,Here the.
2987,0,Top button was clicked.
2988,0,So that would be the text that it would display.
2989,0,"Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here."
2990,0,Let me just copy this.
2991,0,And declare another one.
2992,0,It should be called the bottom bottom.
2993,0,And then let me change the ID here as well.
2994,0,"OK, there we have it."
2995,0,And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well.
2996,0,We'll follow the same steps.
2997,0,Let me just type it for you.
2998,0,So as you can see we have created a logic here.
2999,0,If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked.
3000,0,If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked.
3001,0,So that's it.
3002,0,Hope you understood how to set up the.
3003,0,"On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener."
3004,0,Then just declare new.
3005,0,View on click listener and it would automatically make.
3006,0,A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked.
3007,0,You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
3008,0,Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page.
3009,0,A few things have changed since the last video.
3010,0,I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once.
3011,0,"We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the."
3012,0,Plaintext.
3013,0,So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one.
3014,0,So nothing new in that and then.
3015,0,"The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error."
3016,0,"Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it."
3017,0,This is.
3018,0,"These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own."
3019,0,"We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login."
3020,0,Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here.
3021,0,So we'll be.
3022,0,I will be declaring these.
3023,0,"Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course."
3024,0,So then let's just do that.
3025,0,This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
3026,0,Password.
3027,0,And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
3028,0,Button.
3029,0,"I call it importing, you can call it declaring."
3030,0,"I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button."
3031,0,Will declare that here as well.
3032,0,We call it button simply.
3033,0,And find view.
3034,0,By ID.
3035,0,And the ID is log in.
3036,0,Button.
3037,0,So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
3038,0,"On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username."
3039,0,So for that the if else would finally be used.
3040,0,That we've learned previously in Java.
3041,0,So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
3042,0,Username is.
3043,0,What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
3044,0,And then equals.
3045,0,Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
3046,0,It to be as and let's do the same.
3047,0,I'll just copy this one right here.
3048,0,OK.
3049,0,Let's just have.
3050,0,These brackets separating them as well.
3051,0,Just to keep it organized.
3052,0,OK.
3053,0,So now we'll be using this.
3054,0,"Widget here it's called toast, so it will be."
3055,0,You'll see it when you when we try and run it.
3056,0,So toast dot make text.
3057,0,Here goes the current activity we are on.
3058,0,We are on main activity dot this.
3059,0,As informed previously that would be the.
3060,0,Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text.
3061,0,So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
3062,0,Successful.
3063,0,And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long.
3064,0,And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen.
3065,0,Similarly else.
3066,0,Here we will be.
3067,0,"OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing."
3068,0,Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
3069,0,Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
3070,0,"Or invalid, I'll just write them."
3071,0,In valid.
3072,0,Input.
3073,0,Anything like that?
3074,0,"OK, so that would be it."
3075,0,We declared all three variables here.
3076,0,This one is for username.
3077,0,This one is.
3078,0,For the password.
3079,0,This one is the button.
3080,0,This is the setting up the on click listener.
3081,0,This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input.
3082,0,And let's get straight into testing our code.
3083,0,I think we are all set.
3084,0,So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.
3085,0,Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page.
3086,0,A few things have changed since the last video.
3087,0,I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once.
3088,0,"We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the."
3089,0,Plaintext.
3090,0,So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one.
3091,0,So nothing new in that and then.
3092,0,"The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error."
3093,0,"Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it."
3094,0,This is.
3095,0,"These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own."
3096,0,"We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login."
3097,0,Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here.
3098,0,So we'll be.
3099,0,I will be declaring these.
3100,0,"Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course."
3101,0,So then let's just do that.
3102,0,This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
3103,0,Password.
3104,0,And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
3105,0,Button.
3106,0,"I call it importing, you can call it declaring."
3107,0,"I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button."
3108,0,Will declare that here as well.
3109,0,We call it button simply.
3110,0,And find view.
3111,0,By ID.
3112,0,And the ID is log in.
3113,0,Button.
3114,0,So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
3115,0,"On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username."
3116,0,So for that the if else would finally be used.
3117,0,That we've learned previously in Java.
3118,0,So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
3119,0,Username is.
3120,0,What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
3121,0,And then equals.
3122,0,Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
3123,0,It to be as and let's do the same.
3124,0,I'll just copy this one right here.
3125,0,OK.
3126,0,Let's just have.
3127,0,These brackets separating them as well.
3128,0,Just to keep it organized.
3129,0,OK.
3130,0,So now we'll be using this.
3131,0,"Widget here it's called toast, so it will be."
3132,0,You'll see it when you when we try and run it.
3133,0,So toast dot make text.
3134,0,Here goes the current activity we are on.
3135,0,We are on main activity dot this.
3136,0,As informed previously that would be the.
3137,0,Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text.
3138,0,So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
3139,0,Successful.
3140,0,And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long.
3141,0,And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen.
3142,0,Similarly else.
3143,0,Here we will be.
3144,0,"OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing."
3145,0,Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
3146,0,Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
3147,0,"Or invalid, I'll just write them."
3148,0,In valid.
3149,0,Input.
3150,0,Anything like that?
3151,0,"OK, so that would be it."
3152,0,We declared all three variables here.
3153,0,This one is for username.
3154,0,This one is.
3155,0,For the password.
3156,0,This one is the button.
3157,0,This is the setting up the on click listener.
3158,0,This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input.
3159,0,And let's get straight into testing our code.
3160,0,I think we are all set.
3161,0,So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.
3162,0,"Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is."
3163,0,Actually.
3164,0,Now we have this simple GUI right here.
3165,0,"We have a text, it has an ID."
3166,0,Each one of these has an ID.
3167,0,So we have a background image.
3168,0,We won't be.
3169,0,You know changing anything regarding that.
3170,0,"We have a hide button, we have a page one text."
3171,0,The ID has been this.
3172,0,Now we'll be setting up the on click listener.
3173,0,It would work similar to onclick attribute.
3174,0,Now this is an attribute.
3175,0,If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist.
3176,0,Well it is used.
3177,0,We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform.
3178,0,So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore.
3179,0,The reason being that.
3180,0,"It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now."
3181,0,Because it is.
3182,0,It works for the older versions even here.
3183,0,We tried using it and it works very much fine.
3184,0,But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method.
3185,0,"It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that."
3186,0,"And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute."
3187,0,That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML.
3188,0,"Anyways, so we have this page."
3189,0,Let me just make another.
3190,0,Let me make a few changes.
3191,0,Let me just select the hide button and here.
3192,0,"On click, I'll make sure it's empty."
3193,0,We do not have anything.
3194,0,"OK, it's blank."
3195,0,I have erased anything that was here.
3196,0,This is the basic simple code.
3197,0,Let me just.
3198,0,Change the text right here.
3199,0,Let me just simply search for text.
3200,0,Let's call it Click.
3201,0,Me.
3202,0,So this is the text.
3203,0,We'll have to hardcode this as well.
3204,0,Let's just hardcode it.
3205,0,There you see it.
3206,0,So we hard coded it now.
3207,0,Let's add another button.
3208,0,We'll just copy this one.
3209,0,And paste it here itself.
3210,0,Move it.
3211,0,Up.
3212,0,I hope I have put it in between the text.
3213,0,OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
3214,0,Let me call it.
3215,0,Let me give these a different ID.
3216,0,Top button.
3217,0,This would be called the bottom button.
3218,0,Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here.
3219,0,"OK, so now we have added two buttons."
3220,0,Here we have a text in between.
3221,0,And now the real thing will start.
3222,0,So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables.
3223,0,"We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it."
3224,0,Make sure each one of them has an ID.
3225,0,So all of them have an ID.
3226,0,Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
3227,0,Will be declaring it below here.
3228,0,"You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public."
3229,0,I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
3230,0,I want to declare the.
3231,0,"Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that."
3232,0,You use the.
3233,0,You consider the ID and the name.
3234,0,The variable name here as different.
3235,0,"You can give it the same name, but they are different, so."
3236,0,We are declaring the top button.
3237,0,And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
3238,0,Use the button top button dot set.
3239,0,On click listener.
3240,0,Now this right here is very important.
3241,0,You need to.
3242,0,Use this name right here and set onclick listener.
3243,0,What it will do.
3244,0,What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button.
3245,0,"Whenever you click it, it will take an action."
3246,0,Then in the bracket you will write.
3247,0,New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this.
3248,0,Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens.
3249,0,So let me declare the text here as well.
3250,0,Let me call it text equal to.
3251,0,And there we have the text as well.
3252,0,"Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text."
3253,0,Dot.
3254,0,Set.
3255,0,Text.
3256,0,"OK, I was typing it wrong."
3257,0,Type the set text.
3258,0,Here the.
3259,0,Top button was clicked.
3260,0,So that would be the text that it would display.
3261,0,"Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here."
3262,0,Let me just copy this.
3263,0,And declare another one.
3264,0,It should be called the bottom bottom.
3265,0,And then let me change the ID here as well.
3266,0,"OK, there we have it."
3267,0,And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well.
3268,0,We'll follow the same steps.
3269,0,Let me just type it for you.
3270,0,So as you can see we have created a logic here.
3271,0,If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked.
3272,0,If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked.
3273,0,So that's it.
3274,0,Hope you understood how to set up the.
3275,0,"On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener."
3276,0,Then just declare new.
3277,0,View on click listener and it would automatically make.
3278,0,A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked.
3279,0,You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
3280,0,"Students, welcome to another video and here we will be understanding what is an activity in Android Studios."
3281,0,"We'll be seeing it in our Android Studio shortly, but before that, let's discuss what it is exactly."
3282,0,So it is just like a page.
3283,0,So you might have seen that we have different pages.
3284,0,"On each and every application that we come across, for example."
3285,0,This taking example of Instagram.
3286,0,So we have a login page right here.
3287,0,It is one activity.
3288,0,Then we have another page right here.
3289,0,"After you login into a page, after you enter your credentials here and you click on login."
3290,0,It logs in and takes you to the home page.
3291,0,Here you have various options.
3292,0,You have some menus at the bottom which you can click.
3293,0,"Here you have messages, so you can also click on stories."
3294,0,This is a main feed right here.
3295,0,So we have various elements.
3296,0,To each and every page.
3297,0,Now how an Android application works is that.
3298,0,"Just taking an example of this one itself, we have a login page of Instagram."
3299,0,It has various elements.
3300,0,"You can see that it has looking at it from a developer's point of view, not a user's point of view."
3301,0,So.
3302,0,So as a developer you would have a lot of things.
3303,0,"Here we have a logo, here we have a language selector, we have login text boxes where they enter the text."
3304,0,Then we have a forgot your password?
3305,0,It is definitely a link.
3306,0,A web link.
3307,0,Then similarly we have a login button.
3308,0,"So now whenever you see this, what happens is how do we define it here?"
3309,0,"So when we have, whenever the user enters anything here credentials and clicks on the login page, the form is first validated, so it's checked."
3310,0,"Whether or not you have entered your ID and password in the correct format or not, and then later on the after the after it has checked that username and password is correct"
3310,1,", it is directly linked to this page, your home page."
3311,0,So now that means that the.
3312,0,Link Direct link between these two pages is this login button.
3313,0,"Similarly, let's have a look at this page right here."
3314,0,Now here we have various elements.
3315,0,That means.
3316,0,"Well, that means that this is 1 activity."
3317,0,"This is another activity, and."
3318,0,Let's say one wants to open the messages.
3319,0,"So whenever you open a message, there's a pop up, There's a new pop up here, either a pop up or a whole new different page with no elements of the previous page."
3320,0,So that is another activity.
3321,0,"And that means that each and every element, each and every."
3322,0,Place right in on the page is connected or is connected to a different activity.
3323,0,"So that means that whenever I click on this, it will open my profile that is another activity."
3324,0,In this manner every element.
3325,0,Is connected to an activity and these activities we have as we have various activities in app would be full of so many activities.
3326,0,It is just like a collection of activities.
3327,0,So that is what an activity is.
3328,0,You have to understand this.
3329,0,It is very important concept.
3330,0,We cannot move on until.
3331,0,"And unless this concept is clear of activity, take it as a page simply to move from one each and each and every element."
3332,0,"If an element is functional, you click on it and anything opens."
3333,0,That means it is taking you from one activity to another.
3334,0,"And to do so, what do we use?"
3335,0,"Well, we used this thing mentioned right here, Intent."
3336,0,Intent is a class in Java that helps us to move from one activity to another.
3337,0,So we'll be using Intent and understanding it.
3338,0,"In the next video, we'll be moving from one activity to another as well."
3339,0,"And later on, it will help us in our project."
3340,0,Understanding of this is very important again.
3341,0,So we'll do it practically here.
3342,0,Hope you've understood the theoretical point of view of the activity.
3343,0,So let's meet in the next video.
3344,0,"Till then, make sure."
3345,0,"That these concepts are clear and let's move, OK?"
3346,0,Since welcome to another video and here we will be understanding how to move from one activity to another and let's get started straight away.
3347,0,I have an empty activity.
3348,0,I removed the default hello world from here.
3349,0,So firstly the steps would be quite simple.
3350,0,Let me add a text here.
3351,0,So I'm just dragging and dropping a text.
3352,0,And here I want to enter you are on the first activity.
3353,0,So that will tell us the activity that we are on.
3354,0,Let me.
3355,0,Adjusted somewhere in the middle.
3356,0,Let me just adjust it above it.
3357,0,"OK, so let me constrain that as well and then."
3358,0,I'll give it OK text view one.
3359,0,We will keep it as it is.
3360,0,Now I have added this.
3361,0,"Then let's add another number, I mean another button and."
3362,0,Without the text here.
3363,0,Activity 2.
3364,0,"So whenever I want to move to the activity 2, I would be clicking on this button right here."
3365,0,So we are all set.
3366,0,This is our first page activity.
3367,0,Let me just hard code this string right here.
3368,0,And done.
3369,0,We have another problem.
3370,0,"We need to constraint the button, yes."
3371,0,Let's constraint it as well.
3372,0,So done.
3373,0,"OK, so now."
3374,0,We can copy these two as well.
3375,0,I hope.
3376,0,"Copy OK, now let's define another activity."
3377,0,To do that just right click here next and then click on activity.
3378,0,You need to add a new activity.
3379,0,We will choose a an empty activity.
3380,0,And it says.
3381,0,"OK, so now."
3382,0,Let's.
3383,0,So these two files right here are of activity two.
3384,0,Let me move the one that's for activity 1.
3385,0,So this is the GUI for activity 1 and this is the Java file.
3386,0,This is the activity for.
3387,0,The second activity.
3388,0,So I've pasted everything here.
3389,0,Let me just.
3390,0,OK.
3391,0,Umm.
3392,0,I think that was a bad idea.
3393,0,"I should have done it from scratch anyhow, so."
3394,0,Let's just keep it where these were so.
3395,0,282 and 112.
3396,0,So done with that.
3397,0,Another button.
3398,0,"So whenever I want to move to Activity 1 back, I'll be using this."
3399,0,Let me check constraints for this one as well.
3400,0,So it says.
3401,0,85 and 15.
3402,0,"You can constraint it like this as well, just like it was done so."
3403,0,We'll call it 15.
3404,0,"OK, it's already 15."
3405,0,"Nope, here."
3406,0,OK.
3407,0,Done.
3408,0,So we are all set with the GUI for the.
3409,0,First one we can see that we have ur on the first activity.
3410,0,For the second one let me just change it to you or on the second activity.
3411,0,Let me hardcode that as well.
3412,0,So we are done.
3413,0,There's some warning here as well.
3414,0,"Yes, let's hardcode this."
3415,0,"OK, so we are done."
3416,0,So we are done with the GUI.
3417,0,Now it's time to connect these to move from one activity to another.
3418,0,"Every time the user clicks on this button right here, activity two, let me check the ID."
3419,0,"It's simply button, so I'll copy it and now I'll declare the button right here."
3420,0,"Any time it's clicked, we'll be using the intent."
3421,0,So let's.
3422,0,Let's set the onclick listener.
3423,0,And there you go.
3424,0,"So here, now this part right here is very, very important."
3425,0,Now here we will be creating object of the Intent class.
3426,0,You can name it anything.
3427,0,"Very, very important."
3428,0,Just pay attention.
3429,0,We have set up the onclick listener on the button.
3430,0,So now here what we'll be doing is first let's import it.
3431,0,OK now we have created an object you can give it any name then new intent here this part.
3432,0,OK now here the first argument that goes into this one is the name of the current activity you are at.
3433,0,We are at main activity.
3434,0,So this one goes here dot this.
3435,0,So the extension that we'll be using here is dot this then main activity .2 is the target and the extension that it will have is dot class.
3436,0,So intent create an object of that then.
3437,0,In the intent goes to arguments.
3438,0,The first one would be the current activity main activity.
3439,0,"The extension that you need to add is dot this and then in the second one would be the target, the extension would be dot class."
3440,0,Now simply all you need to do is start activity.
3441,0,And then you will pass the object that you created.
3442,0,So that would be it.
3443,0,Simply this is the function.
3444,0,Let me copy the same.
3445,0,And paste it in the.
3446,0,Second one.
3447,0,So we have.
3448,0,I hope we have the same ID.
3449,0,"No, it's called."
3450,0,Let me call it button.
3451,0,"OK, it already exists."
3452,0,There's some issue.
3453,0,"Leave it, we'll give it."
3454,0,Button.
3455,0,"OK, so let's give it."
3456,0,So the ID that we imported is BTN.
3457,0,Anyways other things would remain same except this part right here.
3458,0,Now our target is different and our current activity is actually the activity too.
3459,0,So the extension that would go here would be dot this and then.
3460,0,This first activity is the target.
3461,0,"So whenever the activity 2 button is clicked, it should move from activity."
3462,0,"Sorry activity 1 button is clicked, it should go from activity 2 to activity 1."
3463,0,So let's just.
3464,0,And that's the whole process.
3465,0,So we have created.
3466,0,Two of these we have created.
3467,0,2 interfaces 1 of activity 2 and one of activity one and then we connected it using the intent.
3468,0,So let's execute and see.
3469,0,"Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is."
3470,0,Actually.
3471,0,Now we have this simple GUI right here.
3472,0,"We have a text, it has an ID."
3473,0,Each one of these has an ID.
3474,0,So we have a background image.
3475,0,We won't be.
3476,0,You know changing anything regarding that.
3477,0,"We have a hide button, we have a page one text."
3478,0,The ID has been this.
3479,0,Now we'll be setting up the on click listener.
3480,0,It would work similar to onclick attribute.
3481,0,Now this is an attribute.
3482,0,If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist.
3483,0,Well it is used.
3484,0,We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform.
3485,0,So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore.
3486,0,The reason being that.
3487,0,"It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now."
3488,0,Because it is.
3489,0,It works for the older versions even here.
3490,0,We tried using it and it works very much fine.
3491,0,But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method.
3492,0,"It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that."
3493,0,"And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute."
3494,0,That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML.
3495,0,"Anyways, so we have this page."
3496,0,Let me just make another.
3497,0,Let me make a few changes.
3498,0,Let me just select the hide button and here.
3499,0,"On click, I'll make sure it's empty."
3500,0,We do not have anything.
3501,0,"OK, it's blank."
3502,0,I have erased anything that was here.
3503,0,This is the basic simple code.
3504,0,Let me just.
3505,0,Change the text right here.
3506,0,Let me just simply search for text.
3507,0,Let's call it Click.
3508,0,Me.
3509,0,So this is the text.
3510,0,We'll have to hardcode this as well.
3511,0,Let's just hardcode it.
3512,0,There you see it.
3513,0,So we hard coded it now.
3514,0,Let's add another button.
3515,0,We'll just copy this one.
3516,0,And paste it here itself.
3517,0,Move it.
3518,0,Up.
3519,0,I hope I have put it in between the text.
3520,0,OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
3521,0,Let me call it.
3522,0,Let me give these a different ID.
3523,0,Top button.
3524,0,This would be called the bottom button.
3525,0,Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here.
3526,0,"OK, so now we have added two buttons."
3527,0,Here we have a text in between.
3528,0,And now the real thing will start.
3529,0,So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables.
3530,0,"We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it."
3531,0,Make sure each one of them has an ID.
3532,0,So all of them have an ID.
3533,0,Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
3534,0,Will be declaring it below here.
3535,0,"You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public."
3536,0,I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
3537,0,I want to declare the.
3538,0,"Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that."
3539,0,You use the.
3540,0,You consider the ID and the name.
3541,0,The variable name here as different.
3542,0,"You can give it the same name, but they are different, so."
3543,0,We are declaring the top button.
3544,0,And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
3545,0,Use the button top button dot set.
3546,0,On click listener.
3547,0,Now this right here is very important.
3548,0,You need to.
3549,0,Use this name right here and set onclick listener.
3550,0,What it will do.
3551,0,What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button.
3552,0,"Whenever you click it, it will take an action."
3553,0,Then in the bracket you will write.
3554,0,New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this.
3555,0,Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens.
3556,0,So let me declare the text here as well.
3557,0,Let me call it text equal to.
3558,0,And there we have the text as well.
3559,0,"Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text."
3560,0,Dot.
3561,0,Set.
3562,0,Text.
3563,0,"OK, I was typing it wrong."
3564,0,Type the set text.
3565,0,Here the.
3566,0,Top button was clicked.
3567,0,So that would be the text that it would display.
3568,0,"Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here."
3569,0,Let me just copy this.
3570,0,And declare another one.
3571,0,It should be called the bottom bottom.
3572,0,And then let me change the ID here as well.
3573,0,"OK, there we have it."
3574,0,And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well.
3575,0,We'll follow the same steps.
3576,0,Let me just type it for you.
3577,0,So as you can see we have created a logic here.
3578,0,If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked.
3579,0,If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked.
3580,0,So that's it.
3581,0,Hope you understood how to set up the.
3582,0,"On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener."
3583,0,Then just declare new.
3584,0,View on click listener and it would automatically make.
3585,0,A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked.
3586,0,You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
3587,0,"Students, welcome to another video."
3588,0,And here we'll be understanding how to make these buttons and any elements in the GUI functional.
3589,0,So it should do something when you click on a button.
3590,0,So what we want to do is we want this button to hide the background image whenever I click on it.
3591,0,So how do I do that well?
3592,0,On this hide button and then.
3593,0,It already has an ID.
3594,0,This background as well has an ID.
3595,0,So just click on the hide button right here and the attribute.
3596,0,"You can always explore the attributes, but here the one that we are concerned with right now is called onclick."
3597,0,We'll be coming back to it in a bit.
3598,0,Now on click means that I will be defining a function.
3599,0,And I'll put in the name of that function.
3600,0,"Whenever the user clicks on this button, it will work according to what is defined in that function."
3601,0,And that function will be defined in the dot Java file.
3602,0,"Now let's define a function to do the same, so public."
3603,0,Void.
3604,0,"Let me give it a name, I'll just call it hide background."
3605,0,"Now, so this is the format that you need to follow."
3606,0,I'll be writing view and then view.
3607,0,Now here what you need to do is alt enter.
3608,0,"That is because you do not, you have not imported the package that was required."
3609,0,And similarly you will define a button here again it shows in red.
3610,0,That means we haven't imported the class.
3611,0,So alt enter button.
3612,0,"You can give it any name, I'll just give it B."
3613,0,Equal to.
3614,0,Find view by ID.
3615,0,R dot.
3616,0,ID.
3617,0,Dot DID.
3618,0,So we have successfully gotten the button right here.
3619,0,So whenever actually you don't have to.
3620,0,"I'm just telling you that if you want to import the button, in this case we do not need the button we want."
3621,0,We are concerned with the background image.
3622,0,So for that you'll be doing a similar thing image.
3623,0,Menu.
3624,0,Equal to.
3625,0,I'll just give it a name image.
3626,0,I think I misspelled it.
3627,0,It's.
3628,0,Image view.
3629,0,Yes it is image view.
3630,0,"OK, we have it imported anyways, so now find view."
3631,0,You'll be using the same method right here R dot.
3632,0,ID let me copy the ID from here.
3633,0,It's this ID.
3634,0,I'll be typing it in here.
3635,0,dot DID.
3636,0,"Now what I want is this is how you import a button, how you import an image, how you import a text view as well anything."
3637,0,So let me just raise this one.
3638,0,We do need a button.
3639,0,Let me.
3640,0,Take this off as well.
3641,0,So now whenever.
3642,0,This button is clicked.
3643,0,I want it to.
3644,0,Go to this.
3645,0,"Method right here, so I'll just type in here."
3646,0,Let me open a split window.
3647,0,So you can also see it side by side on click.
3648,0,So I'm giving it.
3649,0,You can also choose it from the list.
3650,0,So this right here.
3651,0,Is hide background now image named it image.
3652,0,Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a simple thing image dot set visibility.
3653,0,And here I'm going to set it to invisible.
3654,0,So I have set it to invisible image.
3655,0,"I have imported the image, I've set it to image dot set visibility view invisible also you can also make it visible."
3656,0,I've made it invisible.
3657,0,So what it will do is.
3658,0,"Anytime we click on this button right here, it will search for this function and it will find it here."
3659,0,In this function we have defined the image view.
3660,0,We have gotten it using the ID which is background image.
3661,0,I've named it image.
3662,0,Then I have used the same variable and set its visibility to invisible.
3663,0,"In that way, whenever I click on this button it will."
3664,0,It will just simply hide the background.
3665,0,So let's just test it on my phone.
3666,0,I'll just run it and open it in my phone.
3667,0,Let's see.
3668,0,"OK, I connected my phone and let's run it and I'll be switching to my phone now."
3669,0,"Students, welcome to another video and here we will be doing the GUI."
3670,0,So we'll be understanding various parts of the GUI.
3671,0,Let's have a look at it.
3672,0,So a few elements that I want to introduce you to.
3673,0,"This is a shortcut, I would say menu bar where you can."
3674,0,We'll be using it in a while.
3675,0,So this is to hide or see the margins or the constraints.
3676,0,So and here we have a palette.
3677,0,"Palette as in we have the common ones we can just drag and drop here, for example, let's just see this."
3678,0,So this is a button you can just.
3679,0,Drag and drop it and just delete it for now.
3680,0,So you can delete it using the delete key from your keyboard.
3681,0,Just click on it and delete.
3682,0,And this is how we'll be doing it.
3683,0,You can also call it in a split window or the code window.
3684,0,"So this right here, text view, this portion right here."
3685,0,Is for this hello world text right here it shows the layout width and the height.
3686,0,So wrap content as in.
3687,0,If the content is more it would stretch out a little bit.
3688,0,If we increase the size of the text it would increase the height so it will be the wrapping the content.
3689,0,And then Android text is equal to hello world.
3690,0,So we have a text here.
3691,0,"If you want to change it, say I want to change it to."
3692,0,I'll just change it to element.
3693,0,So then you can see it has changed the text to the element.
3694,0,And then we have these 4 constraints.
3695,0,We'll be understanding those in detail right here.
3696,0,So let's just switch to the design.
3697,0,Mode you can see we have a constraint layout here.
3698,0,What do we mean by constraint layout?
3699,0,So if you click on this element you can see these spring like structures on all four sides.
3700,0,So these are called constraints.
3701,0,You can simply take them as springs.
3702,0,So it is just like a spring so.
3703,0,Let me just remove all these constraints.
3704,0,You can just clear it from here.
3705,0,"Yes, so it says clear all constraints."
3706,0,It's also showing me a warning that it lacks constraints.
3707,0,"If I click here, I can see so no."
3708,0,"It's for the hardcoded text anyways, so you need constraints."
3709,0,Why do we need constraints?
3710,0,I'll be explaining it in a bit.
3711,0,But before that.
3712,0,Let's see how to add constraints so you can simply.
3713,0,"Uh, click on the circle right here and give it a horizontal top constraint and the bottom one."
3714,0,I'll just show it in a split window right here so you can see.
3715,0,It has a top constraint.
3716,0,Let me just add another one.
3717,0,So you can see it keeps on adding the constraints.
3718,0,"And this One South due to this, what happens is you can see it's at the bottom of the parent."
3719,0,Everywhere it mentions the parent here parent means the full screen right here.
3720,0,"So if I click on it, what happens is that it will be in the middle of the parent and the bottom, parents top and the parents bottom which is right here."
3721,0,So this is how constraints work.
3722,0,Let's see why.
3723,0,Do we need constraints?
3724,0,So what if I do not have a constraint?
3725,0,I just let me just remove all these constraints here.
3726,0,What will happen is that this element right here can appear in different places on the screen.
3727,0,So that would be a problem as you know that we keep.
3728,0,As you know we an application is not run in a single kind of screen size.
3729,0,"So anytime anything changes, the screen size changes."
3730,0,"It has to adjust, it has to be responsive."
3731,0,"So let's say if the screen size is smaller, the elements should actually adjust themselves."
3732,0,Accordingly.
3733,0,So that is why we use constraints.
3734,0,Let me just drag another text view element.
3735,0,Let's just call this element one.
3736,0,I'll call this element 2 to change it.
3737,0,What you will be doing is you can simply click on it and here you have this attributes tab.
3738,0,It works similar to the way that the code works.
3739,0,You can also make all these changes in the code so you can also see the constraint.
3740,0,Layout here.
3741,0,"Here it says plus, so we do not have any constraints added."
3742,0,I'll just delete it anyways.
3743,0,So let me name this element one.
3744,0,I'll just call it element 1.
3745,0,And.
3746,0,I'll call this.
3747,0,Element 2 I'm just changing the text.
3748,0,So these are the two elements right here.
3749,0,Let me just.
3750,0,Let me just change the height and width to wrap content.
3751,0,"OK, so there we have element 1 and element 2."
3752,0,"As you can see, they do not have any constraints."
3753,0,You can just click on it and you'll see no constraints.
3754,0,Now here what I'll be doing Well let's say this is a text and this is some button.
3755,0,We are we have it on our login screen let's say.
3756,0,So I always want the element to below the element 1 so.
3757,0,What I'll be doing is let me just give it a.
3758,0,Horizontal constraint and let me give this one a horizontal constraint as well.
3759,0,Now what I'm doing here.
3760,0,So I'll give it a bottom constraint as well.
3761,0,"There you go, I'm giving it."
3762,0,A top constraint.
3763,0,OK.
3764,0,"Yes, no."
3765,0,"OK, Now what I'm doing is I'll just tie both these here."
3766,0,Sorry.
3767,0,I'll just tie the element 2 to element one with the constraint.
3768,0,OK.
3769,0,And there you go.
3770,0,"OK Oh my God, it's so."
3771,0,Yes.
3772,0,Let me just.
3773,0,It's not that hard though.
3774,0,"OK, so now with that, what happens is you can see element one right here."
3775,0,It does not have a bottom constraint.
3776,0,Element 2 has all the constraints and you can see that element 2 is tied up between the element 1 and element.
3777,0,So it will always be in between.
3778,0,It will always be in between the element 1 and element 2.
3779,0,"So it doesn't matter if we change the screen size changes or anything, the orientation or the relative position of these elements remain."
3780,0,So element 2 would always be in the middle of the element 1 and.
3781,0,Hit bottom as you can see.
3782,0,"The bottom constraint, the bottom of text view 2 is the top constraint of element 2."
3783,0,So this is how it works.
3784,0,So This is why we use elements so that we can relate.
3785,0,Keep a check on the relative position of all the elements even if the size or anything like that changes.
3786,0,So that would be it for now.
3787,0,This is what we mean by constraint layout.
3788,0,"You have other options right here Constraint layout, then we have linear layout."
3789,0,You could use multiple layouts otherwise but.
3790,0,If you are using the constraint layout then it would remove all other layouts that are used as sub layouts.
3791,0,So we cannot use multiple layouts there.
3792,0,If you are using constraint layout it will be the only one layout that is being used so that would be it for the layout.
3793,0,You don't have to understand the other ones.
3794,0,The constraint layout is a very good layout and it works well with everything.
3795,0,So that is the one that we'll be using here and let's meet in the next video.
3796,0,We'll be understanding a few more things about the GUI.
3797,0,Welcome to another video and here we will be understanding a few more elements of the GUI.
3798,0,So let's start with importing an image.
3799,0,So what if I want a background image right here?
3800,0,So let me just delete this one right here.
3801,0,"And I want an image, so just let me."
3802,0,Let me find image view is the element that we use.
3803,0,Now once I drag and drop here I can see this.
3804,0,There are some predefined ones right here.
3805,0,I want to import an image.
3806,0,So let's click on this plus icon and import drawables.
3807,0,And here we can import any image we want to.
3808,0,Let me just find one that's on the desktop.
3809,0,"I have a few here as well, let me just import one for you."
3810,0,So I have this one right here.
3811,0,Just click on next.
3812,0,Import.
3813,0,And there you can see that we have this image right here.
3814,0,This so now if I try drag and drop I can find this picture.
3815,0,And I can put it here.
3816,0,As the background.
3817,0,So this is how you import any image you want to use as a background.
3818,0,Let me let me get a little bit of a neutral background right here so I had one open right here.
3819,0,"Just let me just reload it so well, whenever you use any image, make sure."
3820,0,"It's simple, simply royalty free so you can just use it."
3821,0,Never use images that belong to somebody else while you were doing a project.
3822,0,Keep this in practice.
3823,0,Let me just find a little bit of a neutral 1.
3824,0,I think this one's OK.
3825,0,This one seems fine.
3826,0,And let's download it.
3827,0,I'll just put it in that folder itself.
3828,0,I think I had one right here.
3829,0,"It's the same one I downloaded previously as well anyways, so here I'll just paste this one."
3830,0,Let me just name it.
3831,0,New.
3832,0,Background.
3833,0,I'll just give it a random name and save it.
3834,0,Let me just close this one.
3835,0,"OK, let me delete it."
3836,0,You can also paste it here.
3837,0,Simply you can drag and paste it in this drawables folder.
3838,0,You can locate it resources and then open the drawable.
3839,0,Here you can just simply drag and drop.
3840,0,I'll just import it like I did previously so.
3841,0,Import drawables from the same one.
3842,0,It hasn't updated it.
3843,0,OK it has.
3844,0,There you go.
3845,0,New background and both make sure it's not too much.
3846,0,High in quality.
3847,0,"Sometimes it rejects it as well, so that might be sometimes an issue."
3848,0,So I have it here.
3849,0,"OK, use it."
3850,0,Adjust it here.
3851,0,"OK, hold on."
3852,0,Let me just.
3853,0,Make it a bit bigger.
3854,0,"I don't think I chose a very nice background, but just for, just for, you know, practice, we'll be using a better one when we do the project."
3855,0,"OK, so now here it shows me a problem."
3856,0,Let's see what the problem is.
3857,0,It's missing constraints.
3858,0,Let's put the constraints here.
3859,0,Then.
3860,0,You can only use.
3861,0,"Probably you can only use the horizontal constraints, that is also fine."
3862,0,"And now I'll just give it an ID, so that is how it will be recognized background."
3863,0,Image.
3864,0,"Now let's make it a bit responsive as in responsive I mean something should happen when I let me just give it a smaller name BG ID, I mean BG image."
3865,0,OK so now.
3866,0,This ID is definitely important.
3867,0,We have adjusted the background here.
3868,0,So this is how you will be importing an image.
3869,0,We'll just add a button here and then we'll finish off.
3870,0,We'll do the rest in the next video S Let's just add a button here.
3871,0,I'll add.
3872,0,I'll drag a button here.
3873,0,"OK, now."
3874,0,"OK, there you go, finally."
3875,0,"So, so just click on it."
3876,0,I'll open the attributes right here.
3877,0,So I'll just give it a name.
3878,0,"I mean a name as in the text, so I'll call it hide."
3879,0,And we need to give it constraints as well.
3880,0,"Again, it says constraints are missing, so you can just simply click on this button now."
3881,0,"It says hard coded string anyway, you don't have to worry about it, it's just a warning."
3882,0,"We'll fix it though, so I'm just naming it hide."
3883,0,Let me just drag it to the middle of the screen.
3884,0,Now what I wanna do is.
3885,0,I'm I'm making it a very simple 1 so I'm going to do one thing here.
3886,0,I want to hide this background.
3887,0,I just want this background to vanish whenever I click on this button.
3888,0,So I want it to be responsive.
3889,0,Let's see how to do it in the next video we have made the GUI.
3890,0,For this and we'll see how to do it in two different ways.
3891,0,"One that's a little bit outdated, it was used previously."
3892,0,"Another one would be the one that is used nowadays, the one that works with each and every application."
3893,0,I will have a look on both the methods and let's meet in the next video.
3894,0,Welcome to another course here.
3895,0,The course is known as Application Development Using Android Studio.
3896,0,So we'll be developing a mobile application or basically learning how to develop a mobile application using Android Studio.
3897,0,The language that we'll be employing here would be.
3898,0,Java.
3899,0,So let's just start with the introduction of what Java is.
3900,0,"Although you should previously have read about Java, and you should know certain basic concepts of Java before you dive into this one."
3901,0,"So just for the introduction sake, we'll discuss what Java is."
3902,0,"Well, Java is an object."
3903,0,Blended programming language.
3904,0,"It is employed at various projects like Android application development and web-based applications, mobile games and so on."
3905,0,Android application development is what we'd be doing today or we'll be learning about it today and Android Studio.
3906,0,So what is Android Studio?
3907,0,"Well, it is an IDE."
3908,0,IDE basically integrated development environment.
3909,0,"It is a software where you can program an Android application and run it, test it, develop it."
3910,0,"Simply speaking, now the languages that are employed."
3911,0,"For this purpose could be Java, C, Kotlin."
3912,0,Android Studio supports all three of them.
3913,0,Java and C were previously supported and later on Kotlin was added as well.
3914,0,Java is the most preferred language to make Android studios and the second one would be.
3915,0,Portland second one second most preferred 1 S that is about Java and Android studios.
3916,0,"Now before we dive into this course, you Start learning new things In this course you will require some basic prior knowledge about Java before we actually Start learning."
3917,0,Or coding actually.
3918,0,"So in this one what you will require is you would need to know what objects and classes are in Java, how to define them."
3919,0,Now I have made a checklist for you.
3920,0,"You can take a screenshot, you can just pause it."
3921,0,Right here.
3922,0,You can learn about each and every concept individually.
3923,0,Or you can take up another course.
3924,0,If you do not know all these things you can take apart another course that's called Basics of Java.
3925,0,So that would work for you as well.
3926,0,Now the concept that you need to know need to know are objects in classes.
3927,0,"Then you would require to know variables and constants, how to declare variables."
3928,0,4th 1 would be data types and conversions.
3929,0,"You must know data types such as you should know int, float, double."
3930,0,"Uh, character string."
3931,0,So all these data types must be known to you.
3932,0,"How to convert from one data type to another is also very often employed here, so you must know that as well."
3933,0,Later on you would know operators.
3934,0,Very basic concept of each and every language.
3935,0,You should know what operators can be used in Java.
3936,0,"Then another concept, control statements."
3937,0,Now these control statements are definitely very important while you are coding because that would decide the flow of your program.
3938,0,"So anything that we want to do, any decision making that we will be doing would be done through these."
3939,0,"Now uh conditional statements if else statements if else, if nested if switch case would be required then the other concept loops loop 3 loop that would be for loop"
3939,1,", while loop and do while loop those would be required jump statements these can be."
3940,0,Kept is optional.
3941,0,You can learn about these or not because generally jump statements are not considered very.
3942,0,"They work though, but they're not very considered considered very reliable."
3943,0,So the two statements that jump statements would be break statement and continue statements then.
3944,0,Very important concept.
3945,0,Functions.
3946,0,So you need to be very thorough with the functions or methods.
3947,0,Same thing.
3948,0,So functions.
3949,0,You need to know how to define a function.
3950,0,You must know how to call a function by value as well as reference later on.
3951,0,"Last second you should know how to work with strings, how to declare a string."
3952,0,And just know a few basic predefined functions that are already there in Java to work with strings and how to use them.
3953,0,"Last but not least, packages you must know you for now, as this course is a bit basic, you would not really require to know how to define new packages."
3954,0,But you would definitely need to know how to use the ones that are already available.
3955,0,"So importing packages, how to import them, how to use them must be known to you."
3956,0,Because sometimes we are using certain concepts in our development while we are coding and it does not really recognize it.
3957,0,That's when the package being imported is missing.
3958,0,So one must know how to import and pack a package as well.
3959,0,So these are the concepts that would be required.
3960,0,"Now, the things that we learned here is that what Java is, what Android studios are, and what would be the prerequisite knowledge about Java that you require before starting this course."
3961,0,So get prepared and in the next video we'll be learning how to.
3962,0,Install Android Studios.
3963,0,Hey guys.
3964,0,So as we were talking about our brand sensor as a.
3965,0,Project for this course I decided it would be a good idea to show you guys a working model of the code.
3966,0,Now as you can see it's a lot of code but.
3967,0,I will walk you through it and you will understand that it's not really as complicated.
3968,0,So first thing you see is I have installed and liquid crystal display which is the LCD display module.
3969,0,I have included its library in it.
3970,0,And these are all the sensors that we're using.
3971,0,"So we have ADHD, which is a temperature humidity sensor, a photo resistor, a soil moisture sensor, a raindrop sensor, which is a rain sensor, as I've mentioned earlier, and a buzzer."
3972,0,So buzzer is basically like a bell.
3973,0,"So if you send it a high signal, it's just creates a sound."
3974,0,And these are all our variables for it and we have an alert message.
3975,0,"Now in setup we are initializing all our pins, LCD display and serial monitor."
3976,0,In this section.
3977,0,This is for our.
3978,0,RDC display or RTC module.
3979,0,So this is actually from a library.
3980,0,"I haven't really created it, but what this essentially does is it makes sure that we are connected to an RTC library and we are connected to the RTC module and it's getting the correct time."
3981,0,Now the first section is I'm getting every value that we need.
3982,0,"So the temperature humidity is soil moisture, the moisture present in the soil."
3983,0,So that is actually being correct collected from here.
3984,0,So the soil moisture actually gives you an analog value which is zero to 1023.
3985,0,But in this case.
3986,0,We need it in a percent.
3987,0,"And in soil moisture sensor, the higher the value, the lower the moisture."
3988,0,So 1023 is the driest and I'm converting it into a percent.
3989,0,So 0 will be the driest.
3990,0,And this is a map function.
3991,0,So this is what we use to convert from 1 range to the other.
3992,0,So here we're converting the.
3993,0,Video of soil Reed.
3994,0,2 From 1023 to 02 the range from zero to 100.
3995,0,And this is photo read.
3996,0,"This is the value that we are reading from the photoresistor, which I've explained is simple."
3997,0,"Sensor which tells us the higher the value, the higher the intensity of light."
3998,0,It just tells you if it's bright or not.
3999,0,"And again, I'm doing the same thing with that."
4000,0,"I'm just converting the light, the photo resistor value into a percent."
4001,0,So I'm converting essentially everything from zero to 100 so it's easier to read and understand.
4002,0,And this is the rain.
4003,0,So rain is actually a little weird.
4004,0,"It gives you low when it's raining and high when it's dry, even though it's called a rain sensor, which should be like an opposite trend."
4005,0,So here I'm just converting its value to the other way so it says hi when it's raining.
4006,0,Not this again.
4007,0,Is the a disc module?
4008,0,It's just giving you what time and date it is right now.
4009,0,"And I'm displaying everything in LCD this way, so I'm calling a function."
4010,0,"Again, as I said, functions are really easy to display stuff that's repeated again and again."
4011,0,So it is displaying every detail that we have from the sensor on the display and that the next function that I have is.
4012,0,Serial display and it is doing the same thing on a serial display.
4013,0,Serial monitor.
4014,0,Here I have checked sensors.
4015,0,Now check sensors is a function which is checking.
4016,0,If every value is in the range that we need.
4017,0,"Like I said, first thing it is striking is the temperature."
4018,0,"If the temperature is what we need, if the temperature is too high or too low, and if it's too high or too low, we are adding or creating an alert message and we are displaying it."
4019,0,On the serial monitor as well as on the LCD display.
4020,0,Then we are checking humidity if it's too humid or if it's if the air is too dry.
4021,0,And we're displaying the required message then it is slight incident intensity.
4022,0,"Same thing we are checking for photopheresis, photoresistors value."
4023,0,But here we are checking it with time because if it is night then photo resistors value will be very low and we don't know that.
4024,0,"We cannot fix it at night, it has to be dark."
4025,0,So here we are checking if the time is too early.
4026,0,"Or if the if it's like midnight, we're not checking the time and if it's like midday then we are checking if it's too light."
4027,0,So we're not checking the intensity of light at night.
4028,0,The next comes moisture present.
4029,0,And this is to see how much moisture there is in soil.
4030,0,"So it's like soil is wet, which means the soil needs to be trained."
4031,0,Here it says soil is dry.
4032,0,So I need some moisture and here if you see every warning statement has a buzzer high and low with it.
4033,0,"This means every time there's something that's not right, the buzzer will ring so person can know that I have to go and check the messages to know what's happening."
4034,0,The next is rain and this is the last one and the rain values if it's raining.
4035,0,We need to cover the plant so there's not too much watering happening.
4036,0,We displayed on serial and on the LCD.
4037,0,Because we have limited space.
4038,0,We just write training.
4039,0,"We hit the buzzer, after 2 seconds we turn it off."
4040,0,"So it's not ringing all the time, but it's just enough so people can go and check, like what's happening and why is it ringing?"
4041,0,"So if it's ringing and I go there, it's it's raining, I know like ohh I have to cover it."
4042,0,"And in case I don't know what to do with it, I go on my serial monitor says cover the plant and I'm like OK, so I should cover it to avoid that it doesn't get overwatered."
4043,0,"But anyways, that's the conclusion of this course and hope you enjoyed it with me."
4044,0,"And hope you liked it as much as I did, so until next time, have a good time."
4045,0,"Hey guys, welcome back."
4046,0,So this time we're working on a keypad.
4047,0,Now a keypad is a simple Arduino.
4048,0,Component which is basically 4x4 grid of buttons.
4049,0,And it is essentially an input device because it has buttons that you can press to send different values.
4050,0,Kind of like a keyboard.
4051,0,Just with the numbers and very limited characters.
4052,0,"Now, if you go to your Tinkercad, your Tinkercad actually has a keypad and this is how usually the keypad look."
4053,0,"Just to let you know if you ever worked with one physically, you have to be very careful and gentle with this because this component of it is very fragile."
4054,0,So I suggest you take very good care of it.
4055,0,"Is if you snap it or fold it in half, you will never be able to work it again because that essentially breaks it."
4056,0,"Now as you can see, our keypad has one through 0 in digits, it has hash and a bound and it has ABCD."
4057,0,And it has 8 pins.
4058,0,Now it's very simple.
4059,0,We connect all of them to our Adreno directly.
4060,0,But the complicated part in keypad is not the wiring.
4061,0,"It's pretty simple, it's decoding."
4062,0,So.
4063,0,If I'm to explain it to you how it is connected.
4064,0,"With these green four and the red 4 cables, they form a grid."
4065,0,So these are four of them are columns and four of them are rows.
4066,0,Their individual columns.
4067,0,"So one is connected to 1/2, is connected to 2-3, is connected to three, and vice versa."
4068,0,"I will change the numbers so first four are the wires, now that's 13 to 10."
4069,0,And then the second floor or the red ones are Geo columns.
4070,0,So here I will put them as.
4071,0,"No, to work with the keypad, there's a keypad library key, capital, everything else is small letter."
4072,0,You include that library and you create a constant variable.
4073,0,"Now constant variable is something that is constant, so something that."
4074,0,Does not have a changing value and it is keyword byte.
4075,0,We have 4 rows and four columns.
4076,0,So we have a rows variable 4 and a column is variable 4.
4077,0,Now we are creating a character array now 2D array so it has a column and row.
4078,0,In this case we have 4 column four rows.
4079,0,We have already defined those and we are calling this array as KP array.
4080,0,Now here.
4081,0,And you're basically programming how it looks like.
4082,0,So.
4083,0,This is the first row.
4084,0,It is in curly braces.
4085,0,This is the second row in curly braces.
4086,0,Again this is a character array so it all everything is in single quotation marks as it is a character.
4087,0,You can also change it around if you want like a different pattern.
4088,0,"If you're looking for some different characters, you can replace it."
4089,0,"But for now we are going with the standard display, so we are following the same display than the original."
4090,0,Keep that house.
4091,0,Nothing fancy.
4092,0,Now you create a variable of Keypad class.
4093,0,We are calling it keypad here.
4094,0,So you go keypad make a key map.
4095,0,So you make a key map using that array.
4096,0,Now row pins.
4097,0,I told you these are the pins.
4098,0,And.
4099,0,We are creating a smaller like A1 dimensional area for all the pins as well.
4100,0,So it is the area of rows array of pins.
4101,0,The number of rows and number of pin columns.
4102,0,And.
4103,0,In order to get the input from a user you use keypad get key K capital.
4104,0,Now the get key will give you the value that is pressed and it will tell you the value based on the values that you entered.
4105,0,"So if you press, say D."
4106,0,First column.
4107,0,1st row.
4108,0,"So that is 1 and here it is first column, first row the value is 1."
4109,0,"It will see that OK, it's the first set, first column, first row."
4110,0,So we have breast.
4111,0,13 and 9 so the conjunction of the wire 13 and 9 is at #1 so it says OK it's 13 and  so that is the first and 1st so 13 and 9 combine it #1 so it will say OK so this one value is number 1 and we
4111,1,will say OK so this one value is number 1 and we storing it in.
4112,0,Press button.
4113,0,And now and then if we have a press button value we are just displaying it.
4114,0,"So here we are not actually waiting for it, we are just like constantly getting an input and as soon as we get an input for press button."
4115,0,We are displaying it now.
4116,0,Let's start a simulation.
4117,0,And I'll open the serial monitor.
4118,0,It's this one and the first one.
4119,0,Let's press D1D.
4120,0,945-B.
4121,0,"Now Keeper is a really fun thing to use, especially."
4122,0,The most prominent example I can see is a passcode machine.
4123,0,"So if you ever pay something with your card, you have a keypad that you enter your PIN on."
4124,0,And that is pretty much the same thing that we're doing here.
4125,0,So you if you want to like help make some fun projects using a keypad
4125,1,", you can create a project like an intruder alarm where someone has to enter a password to open the door and if they enter a wrong password multiple times."
4126,0,Or you send an emergency e-mail.
4127,0,Or you send a call to someone.
4128,0,Or you can just like play a calculation game so you can give someone 5 into 3 and they have to enter the answer so they will press 1 and 5.
4129,0,And you can convert the D.
4130,0,Key to enter.
4131,0,"So whenever they press that button, it enters their value."
4132,0,"So if they have entered 15 and they press T, that means they're giving like, yeah, that's my answer."
4133,0,Or you can do a multiple choice ABCD.
4134,0,They press different choices can you can have a number of things that you can do with it.
4135,0,You can.
4136,0,Just have fun with it.
4137,0,"It's always best to experiment, especially without."
4138,0,"We know the more you play with it, the more you learn."
4139,0,So that's it for today and have some fun with it.
4140,0,"Hey guys, welcome back."
4141,0,"So in the previous videos we saw how we can use digital and analog pins, how they are different and we saw how to use loops."
4142,0,"So for this video, I think it's best that we start with if or the conditional approach, so to demonstrate that."
4143,0,Use a push button.
4144,0,"The LED structure is the same, but for this one I will connect it to the digital pin again."
4145,0,And I will use #7.
4146,0,And for the push button.
4147,0,"As you can see it has four pins and you will also find some that has 2 pins, but for Tinkercad we have the one that has four pins on it so we are only going to use two of them."
4148,0,So one of these will be connected to the positive terminal.
4149,0,"Now this is slightly different than LED's, because for this we only need."
4150,0,The signal to reach the Arduino when it's fully connected or when it's.
4151,0,Properly working when pressed.
4152,0,Basically so it will only reach the current from from the button will only reach the Arduino at pin number 2 when it is pressed.
4153,0,So that is when the circuit will be complete and it will be running.
4154,0,"No, like just like LED, we are also going to use a resistor for this one."
4155,0,"But for the push button, the resistor's value is slightly different."
4156,0,"Instead of 330 ohm, we are using 10K ohms."
4157,0,I'm gonna turn it here.
4158,0,And connect this one to the negative terminal.
4159,0,"Positive and negative completes the circle, so completes the circuit and this yellow wire is what is what's connecting to the."
4160,0,Arduino.
4161,0,So that's what is giving the signal to Arduino if it's turned on or off.
4162,0,"So how this works it whenever the button is pressed, the circuit is complete."
4163,0,That means current starts flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.
4164,0,"What that means when the current when the button is not pressed, there's no current passing through the yellow wire, so there's no current reaching the pin number 2"
4164,1,", so there's no current reaching the pin number 2, so pin number 2 has nothing coming in it."
4165,0,"But when the button is pressed, the positive current will flow to the pin number 2, so the Arduino is able to read if it's getting some."
4166,0,So if it receives some current on that pin that means it has a high value and that means it's on.
4167,0,But if it is not receiving any value that means it is off.
4168,0,So when the button is pressed it will say I have a high value so the button is pressed.
4169,0,"OK, so let's start programming it."
4170,0,For this one I want to show you how we do this by First we need to fix the pen mode for the LED.
4171,0,"Again, we know it's now pin number 7 and that's for output pictures."
4172,0,"Does not give you any value back to the Arduino, it only takes the command, but for the button it's the reverse."
4173,0,"So button is telling something to add, you know, so it will be."
4174,0,So we are going to use spring pin mode pin number two.
4175,0,"It's supposed to take input, so it's supposed to read what the Arduino or the what the button is telling it."
4176,0,So I will do a really simple code here.
4177,0,So if the button says that it's high.
4178,0,Or that it's pressed.
4179,0,The LED should turn on now.
4180,0,How do you know if the button is pressed or if the signal is high now?
4181,0,Like it is still right?
4182,0,It's supposed to tell a digital signal.
4183,0,Digital read will tell help you read a digital signal.
4184,0,"So digital read, what are we reading?"
4185,0,"We are reading pin number 2, so we are constantly checking if pin number 2 has a value coming to it."
4186,0,"If the pin number 2 has a high value that means the circuit is complete, which only happens when the button is pressed."
4187,0,So that means the button is pressed.
4188,0,"Now if the button is pressed, what do we want to do?"
4189,0,We want to make sure the LED is on again.
4190,0,We have done this a couple Times Now.
4191,0,So we turned it on by doing digital right.
4192,0,"At the pin number 7, because that's where the pin, that's where the LED is and turn it high."
4193,0,"Now we can turn it off at the same time, but for me I prefer having a small delay of at least 500 that's half a second so we can actually see the transition."
4194,0,Let's start.
4195,0,I missed the bracketeer.
4196,0,And noticed.
4197,0,OK.
4198,0,So if you see nothing is happening because button the circuit is not closed.
4199,0,"But once I press it, the circuit should complete and the LED should turn on."
4200,0,"Press it, LED is on."
4201,0,"But now when I leave it, it is not turning off."
4202,0,Why?
4203,0,Because we have nothing that's turning it off so.
4204,0,Once it is on.
4205,0,"It is staying on no matter what, right?"
4206,0,So I will stop the simulation and I will put a else condition here.
4207,0,"So if the button is pressed, we are turning it on, but if the button is not pressed we make sure that it is turned off."
4208,0,"Again, make sure your keywords like input, output, high and low are all in capitals and even the words the keywords like pin mode, digital read, digital write"
4208,1,", digital read, digital write, they have the correct cap so they have the correct capital letter on SM."
4209,0,"A bit more should be capital W in digital, right?"
4210,0,"Digital read, R should be capital, analog write and we should be capital and same goes for other keywords that we will use along the way."
4211,0,"Because if one of them is not written correctly, one of them is in the correct capital state, it will not work and it will throw an error like it did for a missing bracket."
4212,0,"OK, now it should turn off whenever the button is not pressed."
4213,0,So right now nothing is pressed so it is off.
4214,0,Once I press the button it turns on.
4215,0,"Now when I leave it, this digital read signal will is no longer high so it will jump to the else clause and it will go digital right low."
4216,0,I left it and eventually went off.
4217,0,"Now when I press it, it's on again."
4218,0,Then I'll leave it it's off.
4219,0,Now it is simple enough and after this we will start jumping into a bit more complex part of it.
4220,0,So it will start getting complicated and it will.
4221,0,Pick up the speed because now we have covered some of the basics and we will start speeding it up.
4222,0,So for this one what I want you to try doing is add a multiple LED's and make sure they work have different combinations.
4223,0,You can also try putting 2 buttons together so if both the buttons are pressed LED should turn on.
4224,0,If one button is pressed nothing should happen.
4225,0,To do that you can try.
4226,0,Putting them in series.
4227,0,"So if two buttons are connected together and they only have one, or they only have a common wire that's connecting it to the Arduino, it should work easily."
4228,0,So everything should be same.
4229,0,I'm just adding another button here.
4230,0,Like there's another button here.
4231,0,"And it it has its own complete circuit, but it should work interconnectivity."
4232,0,"So when 1 is on, the other is on, only then the LED should turn on."
4233,0,Or you can add multiple LEDs and play with it and figure out how things work.
4234,0,Because as as much as you mess with the Arduino on especially.
4235,0,You can experiment different ways and find out how things work better.
4236,0,"It's all on practice, so keep practicing and we'll see you"
4237,0,"Hey, welcome back guys."
4238,0,"One last lecture, I showed you how we can turn an LED on and off using digital, right?"
4239,0,"But that's how you use digital pins, right?"
4240,0,"Digital pin have an on and off, a high and a low signal."
4241,0,But then what does analog mean now?
4242,0,"Like digital has on and off, like computers, it has zero and one."
4243,0,Analog actually has a range of values.
4244,0,"It can go from zero to 1000 and it can go from zero to 255 and values like that, and it pretty much depends on what device you're working with."
4245,0,So let's see how that works with an LED.
4246,0,"Now in LED, one thing that I know for sure is the values go from zero to 255."
4247,0,"So that is the range we work in when we are using LEDs 0 to 255, how we will use it or how it is implemented."
4248,0,"So to start with that first, instead of connecting to a digital pin like #7, we will connect it to an analog pin."
4249,0,See number 80.
4250,0,I can change its color to.
4251,0,Bank so you have you can easily see the difference how it's working.
4252,0,"Alright, that's not too visible, so let's go for a yellow."
4253,0,Now the code pretty much remains the same.
4254,0,"We don't change the code much, the only thing we change is the digital right."
4255,0,Statement changes.
4256,0,So how does the right statement changes now?
4257,0,"Digital, right in the name itself, it means we are writing or we are giving a digital signal or a digital command."
4258,0,"So we will change that to analog, right?"
4259,0,Now what does analog write do?
4260,0,It is used to send an analog command.
4261,0,So we are sending an analogue right to pin 7.
4262,0,And we will send it to 2255.
4263,0,No for LEDs.
4264,0,255 means high.
4265,0,That means.
4266,0,For the brightness.
4267,0,OK.
4268,0,And the zero which is the other extreme of the range means low.
4269,0,That means.
4270,0,Totally off.
4271,0,So any value in between?
4272,0,Will actually be the level of brightness.
4273,0,So 0 being the lowest brightness and 255 being the highest brightness.
4274,0,"So if you say a number like 125, that will be kind of like a medium brightness on the LED."
4275,0,"Again, the the brightness or level of brightness will vary based on the number."
4276,0,So if I say I'm doing analog right on this.
4277,0,"Now the pain is no longer 7, it is a 0."
4278,0,So I will change it to a zero both here and pin mode just so our Arduino knows which pin we are working with and I will give it a analog write signal of 255.
4279,0,That means analog write of.
4280,0,Full brightness and here I will give it an analog signal.
4281,0,"Of zero, that means it should turn completely on, stay on for one second, and then convert completely off and stay off for one second."
4282,0,Pretty much the same thing we did in our previous video.
4283,0,Now the one thing that happened was I did not change it so it could not execute properly.
4284,0,So let's start.
4285,0,Knows it's turning on for one second and turning off for one second.
4286,0,Now let's stop the simulation.
4287,0,And see how the range will work.
4288,0,So for that I will comment this stuff.
4289,0,Ohh let's remove it for now and I will put a for loop.
4290,0,So for this loop we are going from zero.
4291,0,So we were going from intensity 0 to.
4292,0,255.
4293,0,And we will increase the value by 10.
4294,0,After each loop.
4295,0,"No, because it is an analog value, we do not have to turn it on and off."
4296,0,"If we just need to turn it off, we can just pass the value 0 and it will be off."
4297,0,So we don't have to use multiple digital right or analogized statements.
4298,0,A single analog write statement will do perfectly in this situation.
4299,0,Through Analog Writing ZA 02.
4300,0,Have the value of I and then I want it to stay for 500 milliseconds.
4301,0,"That's half a second, so we can actually see it changing."
4302,0,Now the only thing with Tinkercad is you cannot actually see the fading in or fading out or the gradual increase in brightness and gradual fall in.
4303,0,Because that's how it's programmed to work.
4304,0,It only gives you total brightness and total darkness.
4305,0,On an LED.
4306,0,So to make sure this works perfectly you will have to work on it on your actual Arduino and see how the brightness changes.
4307,0,"But in this case, what should happen on your real Arduino is that first the eye value will be 0, so it will be dark, then it goes to 10, so it will be slightly bright, and then it will go to 20"
4307,1,", and then it will go to 20, so a little more brighter."
4308,0,"And by the time it reaches 255, or in this case 250 because we're increasing it by 10."
4309,0,It should be as bright as it can go out on that value in that loop and then it should go back to zero.
4310,0,Why?
4311,0,"Because once it reaches 25250, it will execute and it will go to 260."
4312,0,But 260 does not satisfy the condition.
4313,0,"So it should complete the void loop and then because it repeats, it should start from again and that means is reset to zero."
4314,0,"OK, now let me show you now again you will not be able to see the gradual fade."
4315,0,But this is how it works.
4316,0,The reason you will not be able to see the fade in the values is because you're not programmed.
4317,0,This is not programmed to work like that.
4318,0,So for the next.
4319,0,"To follow up on this video, I would like to try using while loop to do the same thing."
4320,0,Now while loop is another kind of loop that we use.
4321,0,"It has just slightly since textual differences, but it should work the same way and when you use it on your actual Arduino you will be able to see how it changes and."
4322,0,And.
4323,0,"For this one, we're increasing the value."
4324,0,Try doing the reverse.
4325,0,So try starting from the brightest and eventually go into the darker side and see how it turns out.
4326,0,See you in the next video.
4327,0,Welcome back guys.
4328,0,So this time we are working on server motor.
4329,0,"Server motor is pretty simple, it's a motor with a movable arm on it and based on how many degrees of rotation you program it to, it will rotate that many degrees."
4330,0,The only problem with the servo motor.
4331,0,"It can only go up to 180 decrease, so you only have a fixed range of motion in it."
4332,0,"But still it's very useful in some cases, like opening a box or making an automatic door."
4333,0,In that case the server motors are really helpful where you don't want something to spring completely open.
4334,0,And you only want to have a limited range of motion in it.
4335,0,So let's get to programming it.
4336,0,Server motor is pretty simple to wire again.
4337,0,Usually a several motor comes with a.
4338,0,Been set so it's 3 pins combined and based.
4339,0,"Usually there will be wired in three colors so yellow or orange, red and brown, brown or black."
4340,0,So that is the one you connect to ground.
4341,0,The middle one which is usually red is the one you connect to power and the yellow or orange or green depending on the color.
4342,0,You actually connected the.
4343,0,Now like other.
4344,0,"Sensors that we have recently used, it also takes the library."
4345,0,It is a it is called servo dot edge.
4346,0,"Once you include the library, which I'm confident you guys know how to do that, we create a server mode, a library variable."
4347,0,So servo motor is here is the variable for server motor.
4348,0,For the service they provide.
4349,0,"So whenever we refer to the servo motor itself, we use this variable because it is linked to that library."
4350,0,Now we have it at A1.
4351,0,And here is the degree of rotation.
4352,0,"As I told you, we only go from zero to 180."
4353,0,That's what we're doing.
4354,0,First thing we do is we attach the pin number to the servo motor.
4355,0,Here it is a special function that we don't normally use.
4356,0,It is servo motor dot attach.
4357,0,And in brackets he put the pin number.
4358,0,This tells Arduino that if the servo motor specifically is connected to this pin.
4359,0,And now in loop we actually not writing the code here we're calling 2 functions.
4360,0,No functions.
4361,0,I thought that was an interesting concept to introduce here.
4362,0,So if you have a piece of code that you are repeating all the time in your code.
4363,0,So say there's like 3 lines that you're repeating every 2-3 sentences.
4364,0,So instead of copy pasting it again and again.
4365,0,What do you do?
4366,0,"You create a function so say, avoid repeating lines."
4367,0,And in that function you write those 3 lines.
4368,0,"And instead of writing those 3 lines every other line, or every other section of your code you just write, you just call that function."
4369,0,"So three random lines, 3 random lines, 3 random lines."
4370,0,In that way you shorten your code and you make it more easier to read and work with.
4371,0,So suppose.
4372,0,"If you decide to change one of those 3 lines, instead of changing it from 10 different places, you only change it at one in the function"
4372,1,", you only change it at one in the function, and all the other tendencies are already changed because they're all picking up from the same location."
4373,0,That is kind of what we're doing here.
4374,0,So we have two functions.
4375,0,"One is moving 90°, which will move your Arduino 90°."
4376,0,And then bring it back 19° and the same thing that we're doing with 180.
4377,0,Let's focus on 90° first.
4378,0,So in the function for 90°.
4379,0,We are using the for loop if you remember how to use a for loop.
4380,0,Which is very simple.
4381,0,"You're going from zero to 90 and every time you're increasing its value by one, because A+ plus means a equal to a + 1."
4382,0,So here we are actually writing the degree to the servo motor.
4383,0,"So first we're telling server motor if you say right zero, then we're telling server motor go to position zero and then we give it one go to position one or go to 1°."
4384,0,"Then we suppose down the line we give it servomotor dot right 45, it will go to 45°."
4385,0,So we have enough time to see the rotation and after that we are slowly returning back from 90 to 0.
4386,0,So it's coming back to its original position.
4387,0,It's pretty straightforward.
4388,0,Let's see.
4389,0,90°.
4390,0,Now let's slow it down a little bit so we can.
4391,0,See it happening?
4392,0,"It went 90°, then it came back 90°, went 90° and then it came back."
4393,0,Now let's do the same thing but.
4394,0,180°.
4395,0,"Instead of having to comment these all lines, I only have to comment there's one line, so that makes it a lot easier because these functions are not executed unless they are called."
4396,0,So even if I have 20 functions.
4397,0,And I only need to execute one of them.
4398,0,"If I only call that single one, only that will be displayed executed."
4399,0,Having 20 functions doesn't mean all 20 will be executed even if they are not commented.
4400,0,180°.
4401,0,180° and it comes back.
4402,0,So this is a server motor.
4403,0,"Again, it is a very simple concept, but it is a very practically useful one."
4404,0,"Now again, just because we're working with something like Arduino, it doesn't mean everything has to be really complicated and everything has to be really."
4405,0,Difficult to process or difficulty use.
4406,0,"Some things like there's beauty in simplicity, so if something is easy."
4407,0,"That does not mean it's bad, it means it is used in something in a different way."
4408,0,And something that's easier for you may be difficult for other people.
4409,0,"So just because something is very easy to work with, it doesn't mean it is not useful."
4410,0,"And which is one thing that people usually struggle with, if something is really easy, they don't realize that it is useful."
4411,0,"I know this is easy about something complicated, but."
4412,0,"To understand complicated stuff, you need to learn the basic ones."
4413,0,That's why I keep throwing some simpler stuff in the mix so it is easier for everyone and it sort of keeps changing the pace so it's.
4414,0,Never boring.
4415,0,"It's fresh, so if you're struggling with one thing, you get some time to catch up with the next one."
4416,0,"OK, so."
4417,0,"That's it for this one, but see you next time."
4418,0,Hello everyone welcome back.
4419,0,Now since we have completed serial display now we are moving on to LCD display.
4420,0,Now in LCD display we actually use a library.
4421,0,And it is the first time we are using a library here.
4422,0,"But don't worry, it's pretty simple and pretty straightforward an LCD display like you know it's."
4423,0,"Display screen, which you can actually plug into your Arduino using jumper cables or a breadboard and."
4424,0,"Display messages on it instead of using a serial monitor, because in serial monitor you're essentially bound to a monitor or a computer where you have to connect it physically."
4425,0,And it is not very convenient most of the time.
4426,0,"So if you want to leave your Arduino in a place where you don't have room or it is not just not practical enough to carry your laptop or your computers, there they are doing a project."
4427,0,You can use an LCD display for displaying messages.
4428,0,Now how do we work with this?
4429,0,"Again, it is pretty simple."
4430,0,Connection for this it It does have a lot of wires so don't be worried about it.
4431,0,It does take a few minutes or a few times to get used to it.
4432,0,"So if you see from this end, the outer wire is connected to negative terminal and the inner one is to positive terminal."
4433,0,This happens on the both the edges.
4434,0,So outer ones are negative and inner ones are positive.
4435,0,So that's the.
4436,0,2 pins on either of the edges.
4437,0,No the side that says DB 7 so it goes from DB0 to DB7 so you start pinning it from DB7 through B4.
4438,0,So you have these 4 pins that you actually connect to your Arduino.
4439,0,Now for this we generally use the dish soap pins and then you skip DB3 to DB0.
4440,0,So you skip these four and you see the East.
4441,0,Again it goes toward.
4442,0,We know the RW goes to the negative terminal and then we get the Rs.
4443,0,This goes to the Arduino again.
4444,0,After Mrs.
4445,0,"Nelson's, we have already covered the last two on the edges."
4446,0,We only have the one in the middle.
4447,0,That's the V-0 which is left to connect.
4448,0,Now V-0 we actually connect to the middle pin.
4449,0,Of a potential meter.
4450,0,"Now, what is the potential meter and what does it do?"
4451,0,We'll get to that.
4452,0,"The outer 2 pins of the potential meter are one is connected to, +1 is connected to negative."
4453,0,"It doesn't matter which one you do, just one is negative and one is positive and the middle one is connected to LCD display."
4454,0,Now Violet talked to you about.
4455,0,The work of potential meter in this case.
4456,0,I will leave this up so you guys can note down or pin your adrenal.
4457,0,Do you also do display?
4458,0,Potential meter is kind of like a dialogue.
4459,0,You can rotate it and adjust its value so.
4460,0,"In this case, this value determines the contrast of the alphabets displayed on your Arduino screen."
4461,0,Or on your LCD screen.
4462,0,"So if you feel like it's not contrasting enough and it's not really readable, you can twist it enough and increase the contrast, or decrease the contrast to make it more visible and more readable."
4463,0,"Now I hope you guys have connected it, so let's move on to the coding section."
4464,0,"No, as I said, we use a liquid Crystal library which is capital L and capital C."
4465,0,We connected using a hashtag include.
4466,0,Now this is a keyword which helps you to install or include libraries into your code.
4467,0,And the second step is to create.
4468,0,A liquid crystal variable which we will use to identify or else we display.
4469,0,"Now in this case I have called this variable LCD, but you can call your variable anything that you like."
4470,0,So we do liquid crystal space the variable name and in bracket.
4471,0,"We have 8 numbers, sorry, we have 6 numbers and those numbers move from Rs to DB7."
4472,0,But we don't point at all of them.
4473,0,We only note down the ones that we have actually used to connect.
4474,0,So first one is Rs.
4475,0,"Rs is connected to pin number 8, so we write 8."
4476,0,"So 8, 9 and then you go from Ed's four to DB7 which is 10/11/12 and 13."
4477,0,So our total becomes 8910111213 and that is what we write inside the brackets for or inside the parentheses for the LCD.
4478,0,Variable.
4479,0,"No, just the way we did it for the."
4480,0,Serial monitor we are going to do an LCD don't begin like in serial monitor.
4481,0,We did 9600 to identify in a serial monitor.
4482,0,"Here we use 16, 2."
4483,0,"Now it can be something other than 16, 2, but we are using 16, 2 because we are using a 16 by 2 LCD display."
4484,0,What that means is we have this display has two rows of 16 digit 16 character spaces each.
4485,0,"So at the time you can display 16 columns, 16 characters in a line and we only have two lines."
4486,0,Now let's go to the displaying part.
4487,0,So first let me comment this thing out.
4488,0,And let's just go with something simple.
4489,0,Simple.
4490,0,"Now, as I said, we have two rows, so we have to determine where we want characters to be displayed."
4491,0,So we need to use LCD set cursor.
4492,0,"Now remember this LCD's not a keyword, it's just a variable name."
4493,0,So whatever your name thinks in this line.
4494,0,Is what you will use.
4495,0,"If you call it display it will be display dot begin display dot set cursor, display dot print, display dot clear."
4496,0,Now for LCD set cursor means we choose a starting point.
4497,0,"Now 00 will be first line, first character."
4498,0,And from there we start printing.
4499,0,So the first alphabet W will be printed at the first line first character space.
4500,0,So it says welcome to Arduino.
4501,0,"And I'm not clearing it, so let's see what this says."
4502,0,"Now, because this is not an ideal setup for Arduino, you can obviously see the warning because the current is high."
4503,0,"Normally it won't happen when you're using a real 1, so don't worry about it."
4504,0,So it says welcome to Audrey.
4505,0,Now NO is cut off.
4506,0,And the reason behind that is because.
4507,0,"This statement in total is 18 characters, so only 16 can be displayed because remember it's only 16 characters faces."
4508,0,So the last two are omitted.
4509,0,"And to make sure they are displayed, we need to do something."
4510,0,And that is?
4511,0,Displayed in pieces.
4512,0,So here it says we only display welcome to in our first line.
4513,0,Let's see.
4514,0,Welcome to this displayed.
4515,0,Now I'm going to add the word Arduino to the second line.
4516,0,I receive 1 and 2.
4517,0,"That means second line, third character."
4518,0,It says welcome to an Arduino comes in the second line.
4519,0,No.
4520,0,"It's pretty simple, you have to actually move your cursor before you start printing it that location, because our display in itself doesn't know, like it doesn't recognize that."
4521,0,It's going beyond the limits.
4522,0,We need to move to the next line.
4523,0,"It does not recognize them, so we have to manually do that."
4524,0,"No, not something very complicated, but something you sure need to plan out."
4525,0,"So make sure everything is 16 characters or less, or use abbreviations if you have a longer message."
4526,0,Now what does LCD dot clear mean?
4527,0,Now sometimes in between displays you have multiple things displaying one after the other.
4528,0,But.
4529,0,Sometimes we don't really notice that they are not in the same line.
4530,0,So what I'm going to do I'm putting a delay function.
4531,0,So you can actually see it changing.
4532,0,So I want so the welcome too.
4533,0,"And the Arduino will now be in the same line, same position."
4534,0,I'm putting a delay so you can see it transitioned from Welcome to.
4535,0,So it says welcome to.
4536,0,And after a second it should go to.
4537,0,"Yeah, it did display Arduino for a second."
4538,0,Let me do this.
4539,0,So you can see.
4540,0,Change this to 500.
4541,0,800 so delay 500 is just like a waiting period.
4542,0,So sometimes if you need something to wait after every step you can do it.
4543,0,Now if you see welcome to and it says Arduino 2 welcome to Arduino 2.
4544,0,Why is that?
4545,0,Because.
4546,0,"LCD does not clear stuff on its own, so you have to manually tell it to clear the lines."
4547,0,"Otherwise it will just overlap and everything, thus remaining."
4548,0,"It will override individual characters that are needed, but others will remain the same."
4549,0,"So it will not clear the whole line, it will just clear the characters that need to."
4550,0,So I'm just going to do an LCD clear.
4551,0,And then it should clear from one step to another.
4552,0,So welcome to now the 2 is not displaying because welcome 2 is cleared and then Arduino is displayed on top.
4553,0,"And I have not done a clear after the Arduino because Arduino is less characters than welcome to, so it will override the whole thing."
4554,0,So we don't really necessarily do that.
4555,0,Now that is it for today.
4556,0,"Hey, guys, welcome back."
4557,0,"So I feel like we haven't really went that deep into the LCD display, so I wanted to just touch base with it a little bit more."
4558,0,Ohh here I have added a button.
4559,0,And I will.
4560,0,"I believe I've already showed you how to connect a button, but."
4561,0,"For a button, you connect to one side with a positive terminal and you connect a resistor."
4562,0,To the negative terminal and.
4563,0,"On the side that you connect to the resistor, you connect it to what we know."
4564,0,So here right now I have commented out all the LCD code.
4565,0,"So right now it's just the button and the way it's working is if the button is pressed, which means the pin number is high, it will print high to it."
4566,0,So let's see how it's working right now.
4567,0,So I press the button and it prints high.
4568,0,Pretty simple.
4569,0,Now let's stop this simulation.
4570,0,"And what I want to do is every time I press the button, it should say the button is pressed."
4571,0,But I wanted to say on.
4572,0,The LCD.
4573,0,Not because we know we have limited space.
4574,0,"I'm not putting the whole sentence, I'm just putting a button."
4575,0,This button pressed.
4576,0,And let's test this one out.
4577,0,It's clear to see what I would monitor and.
4578,0,"I pressed the button and the side button pressed, but as you know it's keep on displaying it."
4579,0,It's not going back.
4580,0,"So what I will do, I'll put an LCD dot clear."
4581,0,I'll just uncomment this one.
4582,0,But I want this line after a certain delay.
4583,0,I don't want this right away.
4584,0,So let's start.
4585,0,And press it.
4586,0,Life.
4587,0,You see once I stop pressing it goes back button pressed.
4588,0,Now.
4589,0,Stop this simulation.
4590,0,"If the button is not pressed, what I want it to do?"
4591,0,Very simple.
4592,0,I want to display something else.
4593,0,I'll just say nothing too.
4594,0,Display.
4595,0,Or.
4596,0,I'll just say nothing.
4597,0,Now if you notice I already have an LCD clear which will clear after every.
4598,0,Loop so I don't have to put an LCD dot clear after every single line.
4599,0,Which is why I'm not putting an LCD clear here.
4600,0,Let's add another line to it.
4601,0,It's constantly saying nothing to display.
4602,0,No one.
4603,0,That is because I don't have anything displaying or I don't have press the button yet.
4604,0,But as soon as I press the button I want to see what's happening.
4605,0,No.
4606,0,Typically it should only be happening once and then it should clear it and display.
4607,0,"But because I'm constantly holding on to the button, it's."
4608,0,"Constantly displaying it, but do you see that it's flickering every now and then?"
4609,0,Now that flickering is because it's doing LCD clear and then it's going and reading again.
4610,0,But that's happening so fast that the LCD doesn't really have a time to fully clear sometimes.
4611,0,"Sometimes it does, but mostly it doesn't."
4612,0,"Now if I reduce the time between the clears even more, it will get a lot smoother."
4613,0,"And it's flickering, but it's flickering faster because it's still clearing."
4614,0,Now what will happen if I don't display or if I don't clear?
4615,0,As I told you it only clears the cells that it needs to.
4616,0,It doesn't clear all the cells.
4617,0,So in this way it says nothing to display.
4618,0,"But when I press it, it says button pressed to display."
4619,0,Now our message does not have to display in it for pressing the button.
4620,0,"It's displayed because when the button pressed, override overrode the nothing to display."
4621,0,It only covered nothing.
4622,0,It did not go to the display setting.
4623,0,Which is why it is important to ensure that you know how your spacing is working and you know.
4624,0,"Ohh, you're clearing it so if you have something to display if I say nothing to display and button to display if I have two messages."
4625,0,And the two displays always in second line.
4626,0,"I don't necessarily have to erase it every single time, right?"
4627,0,I just need to make it look good.
4628,0,So to save the LCD some extra computing time I can just leave it there and don't use LCD dot clear.
4629,0,But.
4630,0,"If we have multiple messages, there's a possibility that it gets overlapped, so it's always important to do LCD dot clear."
4631,0,"Anyways, that's it for this one."
4632,0,See you next time.
4633,0,"Hey, welcome back everyone."
4634,0,"So this time we're actually working with a very simple rhythm sensor, which is called a photoresistor."
4635,0,"Now photo resistor is typically an analog sensor, but here I've connected it to this to open."
4636,0,"As I've told you earlier, we can also use the digital pin."
4637,0,"The only difference is instead of digital write or digital read, we use an analog read and that is what we have done here."
4638,0,Here I have all four photo resistor.
4639,0,How you connect it is.
4640,0,You take a 10K ohm resistor which you connect to its negative side.
4641,0,Leaders.
4642,0,And you also connect that same side to Arduino and you connect the other side to the positive terminal.
4643,0,"I've also added two LED lights, 1 red and 1 blue."
4644,0,"I want the red one to be turned on if the light is above 500, and if the light is below 500 the blue one should turn on."
4645,0,No one is above or below 500.
4646,0,That means the value or the range that photo resistor will give us.
4647,0,"Because photo resistor being an analog device, gives values in a range from zero to 500 or 500 to 1000."
4648,0,So it's total range is zero to 1000.
4649,0,So I have split down the middle and I'm using 500 as my benchmark.
4650,0,So let's see the code.
4651,0,Here again I have.
4652,0,Displayed the pin modes.
4653,0,So 13 and 12 are are LED lights.
4654,0,"And a servant is a photosystem, so I've defined it as input."
4655,0,"No, because I said it is an analog sensor so it has a range of values."
4656,0,I'm just doing an analog read of it.
4657,0,"So if it's analog read, it's greater than 500."
4658,0,The red one is turning on and the blue one is turning off.
4659,0,Now you should be able to see the values on serial monitor.
4660,0,So in order to do that.
4661,0,Just going to do.
4662,0,Going to take this.
4663,0,I'm going to display the value of well.
4664,0,Let's start.
4665,0,"Now if you see very carefully, the both lights are flickering, so one is turning off, another is going on without any real sense."
4666,0,Now that is because.
4667,0,"This is a simulation, so this is not really the real life, but if you do the same thing in real life, you will get much clearer results."
4668,0,The reason you're not getting proper results here is because.
4669,0,"It's think or get and it does not have all the real time values all the time, so some of the values can be flawed."
4670,0,Which is the reason the values from this particular emulator is not exactly reliable in this matter.
4671,0,But still you're able to figure out that it's all working properly and you are able to see how this is flickering among each other.
4672,0,"So if the value is ever above 500, the red ones turning on, and if it's below 500 the blue ones turning on, even though the values are completely random."
4673,0,"That's why I suggest like whenever you guys try doing it, I suggest that you do it without Tinkercad."
4674,0,I would like you to use Tinkercad solely as a planning of the circuit instead of directly creating a circuit because this is not 100% reliable but creating a circuit on Tinkercad.
4675,0,It gives you an idea of how everything is connected and that.
4676,0,"Minimizes the risk the risk of short circuiting or mismatching the wires or wrong connections, which can eventually just damage your equipment that you're using."
4677,0,"But anyways, this was a really short introduction to photo resistors."
4678,0,I thought it would be fun for you guys to have a look at it.
4679,0,And that's it for today.
4680,0,See you tomorrow.
4681,0,-----------------Arduino-Video 9------------
4682,0,"Hey guys, now we're working on another sensor and that's temperature and humidity sensor."
4683,0,Now for this sensor we use DHT library pretty similar to how we used Liquid Crystal library for.
4684,0,LCD display the same way we used HD library for temperature and humidity sensor.
4685,0,"Now, one important thing to know about these sensors is there are two different kinds of sensors."
4686,0,There's one DHT 11 and there's a different kind which is DHD 12 or 22.
4687,0,I'm not entirely sure on that.
4688,0,"But in this case, we are using the DHT 11."
4689,0,"Now as the name suggests, it tells you the temperature and humidity of the environment and it's pretty simple, simple to use."
4690,0,"Now there's some complicated versions of using this that I've seen online, but this is the easiest version that I've found and I think you guys will be."
4691,0,Able to learn this pretty easily.
4692,0,Now the first thing I want to tell you about Tinkercad is it does not have the ideal version of DHT 11 that I would like to show you guys.
4693,0,So for this one.
4694,0,"If you go to Google images and this is actually the kind of sensor like DHT 11, this is the sensor that I will be explaining you for because the one in Tinkercad is not exactly programmable as DHT 11."
4695,0,"Now you notice this has four pins, but we only use three of them, so the first one will be the positive terminal."
4696,0,The second one is the one that you will connect.
4697,0,Do your sensors.
4698,0,Arduino pin.
4699,0,Or in this case it will be an analog pin and you skip the third one and the last one will be the one you connect to the ground pin.
4700,0,And it's pretty straightforward.
4701,0,You also need to use a 330.
4702,0,Resistor with the data pin.
4703,0,So you connect the data up into the resistor and that is how you program it and in order to not to burn it which.
4704,0,"Is very easy to do, I have done that."
4705,0,So even if that happens it's alright.
4706,0,"So just need to make sure that you cross check your wiring everywhere before you actually wire it and run it because it is very likely that you end up burning it, which is totally normal."
4707,0,"Now, since you know how to pin it, it's again pretty simple, just three pins, don't use the third one."
4708,0,And that's pretty much it.
4709,0,"And also you can find these images on Google, you just need to search DHT 11 sensor."
4710,0,And you will be able to find it now in order to code it.
4711,0,I can show you the code here.
4712,0,"Now pretty much the way we did with Liquid Crystal, we include the HD library again, DHTML capital and then we actually creating a DHT sensor."
4713,0,"Now this is a variable, the sensor is a variable, and DHD is a class."
4714,0,So you're creating a variable of the Sensor class.
4715,0,And in our case that is an 8.
4716,0,"Now, how do you know that you're displaying a sensor?"
4717,0,How do you know what kind?
4718,0,Because again I said there's two different kinds for that.
4719,0,He used the Read 11.
4720,0,Read 11 tells the art.
4721,0,We know that it is a DHD 11 kind of sensor and it functions accordingly.
4722,0,So we do sensor which is again ADHD variable.
4723,0,Dot read 11 and then we put in the pin number.
4724,0,"The pin number is temperature, humidity sensor A8."
4725,0,Now getting the value for temperature and humidity is very simple.
4726,0,You just do DHT or in this case it is sensor.
4727,0,So you simply do sensor temperature and sensor humidity and it will return you float values of those.
4728,0,Remember they are always float.
4729,0,"And to print them, you just simply print them."
4730,0,"The temperature will come in Celsius, so if you want to display it in Fahrenheit you will have to convert it to Fahrenheit or Kelvin based on what you want."
4731,0,And the humidity is always in percentage.
4732,0,"Now, because we don't have anything connected, I cannot really show you how this works because we don't have this version on Tinkercad."
4733,0,"But again, this is very simple code and the wiring is also pretty simple as well."
4734,0,It's just three pins out of four and just make sure you.
4735,0,"Make it correctly on, especially on Arduino CC which is a really good website for you to use in order to find it and see how it is programmed and how it is connected."
4736,0,Now there are different versions of using DHT library.
4737,0,And there are different versions of DHD library.
4738,0,So this is the one that I use.
4739,0,It is capital DH&T.
4740,0,And I find it very easy because all you need to do to get the values is these three lines.
4741,0,"And it's very simple to use as well because you just use sensor temperature and you have the temperature, you just use sensor humidity and you have the humidity."
4742,0,"And also, this is a really good sensor, like I told you earlier for your project."
4743,0,"So if you want to add this, what I prefer doing with projects is I like working on individual sensors or individual components separately."
4744,0,So I have different codes for all of them.
4745,0,"I work with them individually, make sure they're all working."
4746,0,Separately.
