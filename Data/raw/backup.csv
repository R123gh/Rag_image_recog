(0:00) Okay, now let's make it more interactive. (0:04) Let's take input from the user (0:06) rather than us deciding what we want (0:09) the variables value to be, what should be the number. (0:13) Let's ask the user what is their choice.
(0:16) Let's make the results dependent on what user chooses to do. (0:21) So in that case, we have a lot of classes, (0:25) a lot of different ways to get an input (0:27) from the user on the command line. (0:29) But here we are going to use scanner class.
(0:32) Scanner class is available in java.util. (0:35) So definitely we'll be importing that package. (0:38) And here we'll create these two lines are quite important. (0:42) First of all, we'll create an object of the scanner class.
(0:46) So it says scanner obj, you can give it any name (0:49) equal to new scanner, then system.in (0:53) just to get the input from the user in the command line (0:57) and give it to the scanner class. (1:00) Then int a, int would be the data type, (1:04) a the variable name, equal to whatever name (1:08) you've given to the object. (1:09) Here it's obj, obj.nextint. (1:13) Let's have a look at it in the practical way.
(1:19) So here we have defined a class (1:23) simply user input as its name, (1:26) imported java.util, simply scanner, (1:29) we've created an object of the scanner class. (1:32) Then system.out.println we have shown (1:37) or we've displayed enter a number. (1:39) Now the user should enter the number.
(1:41) Now where does the input go? (1:43) It goes in this variable, int a, you can give it any name, (1:48) int a, next int, I'm sorry, (1:54) you'll need to use the object name, (1:59) obj.nextint, compile it, no syntax errors. (2:05) So what difference does it make? (2:07) It makes a difference there. (2:10) Now they are asking for an input.
(2:15) Enter a number, four, press enter. (2:18) So now we are entering a number. (2:21) Let's make it better.
(2:23) Now let's make the user enter another number. (2:37) Enter another number, we can use the same statement. (2:43) Now we'll print the sum of a and b (3:01) or we can say the sum of both the numbers is, let's see.
(3:32) So how we get input from the user? (3:36) Enter a number, we enter three. (3:38) Enter another number, we enter seven. (3:41) The sum of both the numbers is 10.
(3:44) So now we are in control. (3:45) The user, rather than just using the predefined ones, (3:51) the ones that we've defined in the program, (3:54) we are taking input from the user, (3:56) enter a number, then enter another number, (3:59) then it adds the numbers and gives you the result. (4:02) So input processes it and the output.
<---------------------Video2------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
(0:01) Okay, so time for making your own project here. We'll just try and incorporate everything that (0:09) we've learned in this course. We'll try and implement it and use it as much as possible, (0:17) all the if-else statements, all the loops, switch case, everything that we've learned, (0:22) we'll try and incorporate it.
So let's start with our project here. We'll have, (0:28) we'll display a menu for the user and then user himself can choose which one, what to do. (0:36) So we'll be giving an option, we'll be giving them, we'll be using switch case here in the (0:42) first one.
Okay, let's start. So like any, any other program, we will start it with main function. (1:00) Now let's define a scanner class, a scanner object, I mean.
So using the scanner class, (1:08) we'll take the input. So as you can see, it's underlined because we have not imported (1:26) java.util. Let's import that now. Here, now let's see.
Let's display a menu for the user. (1:40) We'll do certain things for the user. So enter one to check if a number is even or odd.
Let's (2:12) display three more, two more of these. So the user, the user should enter two to divide two (2:26) numbers. User should enter three to join two strings.
So we've displayed a menu here. (2:42) Let's take in the user's choice. We need to use it with the object.
(3:01) There you have it. Now we've taken user's choice in the choice variable. So it's stored there.
(3:08) We'll be using switch case here. The variable that we'll be using is choice. (3:17) In case the user states one, what should we do? We will call a function called even odd.
(3:32) And then so it's telling us that there's no such function, but we'll be defining it later. So you (3:41) do not need to worry about it. So now even odd, that is first one.
Let's just define the default (3:48) one as well. Default, just in case the user hasn't entered one, it will, this one would be executed (4:11) invalid input. Okay, let's let's have the other two switch cases, other two cases as well.
(4:31) So just keep it aligned. So there's clarity. Then the other one would be divide, (4:41) this one would be join.
So these three functions that we've used, in case the choice is one, (4:52) then even odd would be executed. Make sure you use break. Otherwise, each one of them would be (4:57) executed.
Now, outside this function, let's define another function here. First one would be even (5:05) odd. So as you can see here, we are not passing any arguments.
So we are not passing any arguments (5:24) here while we are calling it. So these brackets are also empty. And there would be no return type (5:31) as well.
We are not returning it we are we are doing everything in this one itself. So you do (5:35) not need to write here in float anything like that you don't have to. So now we'll take an input from (5:46) user.
Let's do that. So we are asking for the user to enter a number you can again, create an object (6:13) here. Now one thing that you need to notice is that we need to create another, another object (6:23) here, we always whenever a variable be a choice.
So if it's declared, its scope is within this (6:32) function only the function that it is defined in is the only place where it's valid. If I try to (6:40) use choice anywhere else, it would not work. So it will work only within this region.
So because (6:49) it's a local variable, just in case I wanted to be global, I'll just define it here, just saying (7:00) not doing it right now. But then if you define it here, then you can use it throughout the class. (7:06) Anyways, so coming back to our function.
Now we'll check if a that the the number that you (7:33) user has entered is odd or even. Let's make an else block here. So we have defined it.
Let's just (8:21) compile it. Before compiling it. Let's comment out these because we haven't really created these (8:28) functions.
So it will show us an error, just comment it out so that it does not interrupt (8:33) the compiling compiled with no error. Let's execute it. So now it's asking us for an input, (8:43) we enter one, it's an even number.
If we try to enter anything else. (8:50) For example, if I try to enter even two here, it's in issues invalid input. So let's do half of (8:59) it.
After this, half of our project is done.
<---------------------Video3------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
(0:02) Okay, now completing the rest of the project, let's remove these clashes here. (0:13) Okay, now let's define divide first of all, within the same class. (0:20) So again, similar way similarly, public static, again, it would not return anything, then (0:29) divide.
(0:30) And now it will divide numbers, again, it will ask for a number, we can just copy it (0:41) from here, rather than just typing it all again. (0:45) So first, we define a scanner class again, a scanner object again, and then let's just (0:54) take input, enter a number, enter another number. (1:00) Now we can simply, let's define it float as we are going to divide them, there is a high (1:38) possibility that we have to add, we'll have decimal values.
(1:47) So this is how you will do it. (1:55) Okay, compile, we can compile it. (1:59) But before that, just an exception that could actually happen.
(2:04) What if B is entered as zero, if A is entered as zero, it won't be a problem. (2:10) But in case B is entered as zero, it would be a big issue. (2:16) So to deal with it, what we can do is just write, if B is equal equal to zero, then we'll (2:28) print something else, we'll print do not enter zero.
(2:47) So that would help, it's just like throwing out an exception. (2:52) So that would be very helpful. (2:55) Then, if not, then we can simply just print the quotient or the whatever is the output (3:10) after division.
(3:11) So let's try and compile it. (3:14) Although, yes, we haven't defined this one. (3:18) So we'll define it as well.
(3:20) We need to join two strings, and its name should be string. (3:25) So let's just define the last function that we are left with. (3:39) So we'll be taking input from user, again, the same thing.
(3:47) Let's Yeah, we need to take two inputs here. (3:54) So the data type would be string. (3:59) You can also change the name, but it's not mandatory as we do not as this as A and B up (4:08) there was just valid within the method.
(4:11) So you don't have to, it's not really important. (4:17) Okay, enter a string. (4:22) We're going to ask for a string.
(4:28) Yes, it shows some error. (4:31) Okay, yes. (4:36) Okay, we can simply just, okay, just join two strings.
(4:47) So the first string could be Java. (4:58) Just simply join these. (5:01) And the second one could be, now let's display that what both of these are.
(5:37) The first string is str1, str sorry, then the second one. (6:17) So how do we concat it? (6:19) Let's see, str.concat str2. (6:27) You can also use the plus sign here, you can just simply join it without the concat function (6:32) as well.
(6:33) Let's see what's the error here. (6:36) Okay, we did not use, okay, no syntax errors. (6:45) Let's see if everything works.
(7:04) So it shows odd number. (7:06) Then in case we want to divide two numbers, then we'll enter 2, 6, and then 8, 6 and 7. (7:19) So it gives us the output. (7:21) In case we enter 0, let's check that as well.
(7:24) So we entered 2. (7:27) Now enter a number, we enter 6, and then we enter 0. (7:31) Do not enter 0. (7:32) So it shows us that we shouldn't enter 0. (7:35) So it's working perfectly fine. (7:37) Now the last one, to join two strings. (7:41) So it shows us the first string is Java, second one is programming.
(7:44) After concatenation, the string is Java programming. (7:48) You can just give a little space after is, otherwise, it's all right.
<---------------------Video4------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

OK, so moving further now, we'll understand the if, else, if else statements. 

As you can see in this program we've defined 2 variables. 

We are taking input from the user in the variable A&B.

Now in the first if statement what we are doing is that we are checking if A is greater than B. 

If A is greater than B we'll we'll tell the user the first number is the greater.

Whereas if the case is opposite, if B is greater than A, then we'll say, well, the second number is greater. 

Now the else block contains the last possibility that both numbers are equal. 

So just logically speaking, if A is in greater than, B&B is in greater than.

A. 

Then there's only one possibility, and that is that both are equal.

Find it that we can use as many as if else blocks as much as we want. 

There's no condition placed after else but.

Else if statement just like if has space for expressions that return true or false. 

Now let's check the working compiled. 

Now let's see.

When I enter 5.

It says enter another number, second number is greater.

Let's check if. 

What if we enter both of them?

Six, both are equal. 

So that is how it works. 

Both are equal. 

So this is how if else statement works. 

Now let's close it. 

Let's move on to the second type. 

Now the second type is switch case. 

This is known as switch case.

Nothing different. 

Nothing.

New except this block.

Which I'd be explaining right away. 

Now we defined A variable int day is equal to 3.

Then I use the word switch brackets and then I put in the variable that I want the switch case for.

Then I write various cases when case 1A column.

If the case is 1, by which we mean if the value of day is 1, then it should be Monday. 

Print Monday.

Then I use a break statement. 

Now what break statement does is it would not execute the cases or anything after it. 

No, the control would flow from this line to right outside here after this block. 

So.

After this bracket, the control would flow directly from here to here. 

It will not execute anymore lines of codes in lines of code in the switch case. 

So using a break statement is important. 

It is also called a jump statement.

Now the last one when the case is due then it's Tuesday. 

If it's three then Wednesday. 

Let's suppose that like we we can see here the day is 3 equal to 3:00. 

So it will check this now false wrong. 

Then it will move to case two. 

It won't execute this one because the case is in two.

Then three ohh yes it matches 3 and case 3. 

So it will print Wednesday and break come out of the switch case. 

Now just in case none of them is true, let's suppose the day is 10 or 20 or something. 

Then we have a statement. 

It's called default.

So just in case all of them are false, it will print wrong input.

Let's check it compile.

It shows us Wednesday.

Let's enter 7. 

The day is 7.

The result would be Sunday.

And in case we enter.

In case in case we enter some random number, let's say 800 and 989. 

OK, compile. 

Now none of the cases are equal to 89. 

Let's see the result.

Hence proved that last statement is the one that would be executed. 

That would be wrong input. 

So switch case. 

With switch case a few things. 

We can also use character. 

We can also use a constant expression here for example 6.

Into.

Nine that can be used here. 

So whatever the answer is of this, that would be the case. 

That is what that would be the value that would be the one that compared OK.

Other than that, we can use character data type here. 

But using double for example 8.9897, this is something that's not a feature of switch case. 

We cannot use decimal values here. 

We also cannot use.

Variables like a into B, No, that would be wrong. 

So anything that's constant and is not in decimals can be used.

These are the few rules that we need to follow while using the switch case. 
<------------------------------------Video5------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
Further, we'll understand variables in data types in Java. 
00:06
So in Java we have various data types and they have their sizes, specific sizes. 
00:13
For example, for character we have.
00:17
A data type called care. 
00:20
It takes up two bytes in the memory. 
00:23
Byte, like the name suggests it takes 1 byte. 
00:27
Short takes up two bytes. 
00:29
Integer takes up 4, long 8. 
00:32
So you can read it here. 
00:34
Boolean takes one bit.
00:37
Now for a character, we can store ABC any single character. 
00:42
It could be even space, it could be a symbol, a number, just that it should be in double quotes. 
00:51
We'll understand it in this video itself further.
00:57
Byte, short, int and long. 
00:59
All these four data types store integer type values. 
01:05
What do we mean by integer? 
01:08
So it will be two, 3-4, hundred, 122, anything like that But.
01:16
With no decimal spaces float in double. 
01:20
To the contrary, they take values that have decimal spaces, say 6.26.289. 
01:28
Any of those boolean stores two things, either true or false.
01:36
That's all.
01:39
Now have a look at variable declaration and assignment. 
01:43
So this line right here is an example of how to declare a variable. 
01:49
And this is the representation just to understand it better. 
01:53
So I've mentioned the data type, it's float like you can see.
01:59
We have decimal spaces here. 
02:01
A is name of the variable, so of the identifier. 
02:06
You can give it any name then equal to the value. 
02:11
Here float as the data type A is the variable equal to. 
02:16
Is the assignment operator and.
02:19
This is a constant. 
02:21
Again; We need to use after each and every statement in the memory. 
02:26
Just to visualize it a little bit. 
02:28
We have a space, it has its own address. 
02:32
Just just an example. 
02:33
We are giving it a name, that name is A and we are storing a constant.
02:40
In that variable in that space, now we can change. 
02:45
We can change it to any other number. 
02:49
So the name remains same, the location remains same, the constant can keep on changing. 
02:57
We can.
02:59
We can write a equal to 6, so that's when it will erase this one and enter 66.28. 
03:06
Anything we want to, we can overwrite it. 
03:10
Simply speaking. 
03:10
Let's take a look at it how to do this in a program.
03:17
So opening Blue Jay again, we'll create a new class, give it a name, let's give it name sum a simple program here, so.
03:29
Let's start open it.
03:36
It has already been. 
03:37
You can just.
03:41
It is it completely or just simply?
03:45
This right here is also a comment. 
03:48
Anyways, we do not need it, so we've defined a class public class sum now again.
04:12
So here we'll define a variable.
04:17
Keep it very simple. 
04:18
Int a is equal to 2.
04:22
B is equal to 9, so you can separate it with a comma and then later on put a semi column there we want to print the sum of it.
04:32
So it will be.
04:40
We'll just print a plus.
04:44
B.
04:46
So what is happening right here? 
04:48
Plus is also an operator. 
04:50
We'll study it further. 
04:52
We'll study all the operators that are used in Java. 
04:56
So this is the data type. 
04:58
This is name of variable. 
05:00
I've assigned IT12B has the value 9. 
05:03
Then I've printed the sum of A&B.
05:06
So as per our anticipation, the answer should be the sum of 12 and 9. 
05:15
Let's see, compile it, no errors.
05:21
Then just run it.
05:25
So the sum here is 21 as you can see. 
05:29
So this is how to declare a variable, how to use data types and then use it.
<---------------------Video6------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
OK, so let's have a look at strings. 
00:04
In Java, Strings are nothing but they are text, just like you can see here first how we define a string. 
00:11
It's string just like a data type integer. 
00:14
Then we give it a name and then.
00:17
We assign the value here. 
00:20
Now string is not a upfront straight away. 
00:23
It's not a data type, rather it is. 
00:26
It is a data type, but it's not a primary data type. 
00:32
It's at the back end. 
00:34
It's an array. 
00:35
Now array is nothing but a combination of.
00:39
A data type, so various locations of a data type. 
00:43
So what I mean by that is just like it has been defined here, JVA are characters and it has been combined to make a string. 
00:54
So a string in Java cannot be changed later on, we cannot expand it.
00:59
Because it is defined as an array. 
01:02
Now there are a few functions that we can use with the strings. 
01:06
These are a few. 
01:08
There are a lot more that you can discover on your own.
01:13
Let's dive into it. 
01:14
Let's see how to work with arrays. 
01:17
I mean, sorry, how to work with strings?
01:21
OK, have a look at it. 
01:24
Let's define.
01:29
A class named String use.
01:59
OK, so let's define a string and the string. 
02:03
Why we do not need to import a function or any import a class or anything that is because.
02:12
String is stored in Java Lang which is the default package. 
02:16
So we do not need to import any external package here String let's call it STR we'll call it.
02:26
Java is a language.
02:31
So this is our string. 
02:34
Now how to work with this string we'll first of all we'll display it.
03:05
Let's.
03:07
Let's see the results.
03:13
So the original String is Java is a language.
03:19
Now let's have a look at what we can do with this string.
03:24
So now.
03:29
Let's suppose I want to change it to uppercase. 
03:33
I want all the letters to be capital, so I'll just use a function here STR dot.
03:44
2.
03:45
Upper.
03:47
Case.
03:49
As it's a function, we'll have this. 
03:52
We'll be using dot.
03:55
And.
03:57
We'll also have these.
03:59
Brackets here.
04:02
Let's check.
04:06
Wait.
04:08
The original string is this.
04:12
So.
04:14
The string, we can write it the string.
04:19
In upper case.
04:23
Similarly, we have another one here.
04:32
So it will.
04:34
We'll just write lower here and it will convert it into.
04:40
Lower case.
04:48
OK, we'll see that later. 
04:51
Now we have many other functions that we can use here, the string.
05:05
After replacing.
05:09
Java with.
05:12
Guava.
05:15
OK, now what we'll do here? 
05:17
We'll use a different function.
05:23
Dot replace.
05:25
Now in the first section we will be passing arguments here in Java.
05:31
Cover.
05:34
What we've done here, the first argument is the one that we are looking for the search element. 
05:40
So it will be looking for Java and then replacing it with Kava. 
05:44
Let's execute it and say.
05:51
OK.
05:52
OK.
05:54
Let's compile it. 
05:55
Make sure you keep a check on the semicolons and the brackets and everything.
06:06
OK. 
06:06
And the pop up is here, OK?
06:10
Let's turn it off. 
06:11
Let's try to execute. 
06:13
OK, there you go. 
06:15
So the original string is this, the string in uppercase, the lowercase replacing Java with Carver?
06:23
Let's do something else here now, Carat.
06:28
So we have another one.
06:33
The character.
06:36
Add index.
06:42
3.
06:47
Is.
06:51
Now this one takes the value.
06:56
C should be small OK, so.
07:00
We are looking for character that is at 3. 
07:03
So let me know what you are expecting. 
07:06
What would be the character at third index? 
07:08
The index starts from here.
07:12
At 3rd place, what is the?
07:15
Character. 
07:16
So now the character are third place is a but you would say it's BY. 
07:22
Is it a cause the index starts from zero in a string, so the at 0 it's J, at one it's a second, at second position it's B.
07:35
And 3rd, it is a so this is how it's working. 
07:40
These are a few functions that we can use. 
07:43
We have a few more as well. 
07:46
Let's let's test all of them.
07:53
So we want to know.
07:56
The index.
08:00
Off.
08:02
L.
08:06
So the function for that is.
08:11
Index of.
08:14
And we'll pass.
08:17
And here.
08:26
Index of L is 10, so if you count from here 012345678910, make sure you also count the white spaces in between. 
08:37
They also take up space so you cannot just ignore it. 
08:42
So it won't be like 0123.
08:46
Then we just go to I4 nodes. 
08:48
The space is also counted here. 
08:50
That would be index. 
08:51
So we have various functions like this. 
08:53
You can just keep on trying a few more. 
08:56
You can just have a look at them and just play around with it. 
09:01
It will be easy for you. 
09:03
So this is how we define a string. 
09:05
These are a few functions that we can use.
09:08
With the strings.  
<---------------------Video7------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
OK, so let's start here. 
00:03
First of all, we'll learn what is the method we've been talking about member functions, functions, methods.
00:12
These all are the same things. 
00:15
It's called method or a function. 
00:17
How to define it? 
00:19
Well you'll need an access specifier. 
00:21
It could be public, private. 
00:23
Then you can use the keyword static. 
00:26
Then the return type. 
00:28
Return type is data type. 
00:30
What kind of value are you going to return?
00:34
Then methods name then list of arguments. 
00:37
So our input goes here and the return type will be defined here. 
00:42
A return keyword would be used within the method in the method body. 
00:47
Then we have how to call a function? 
00:51
Well to call a function simply write the name.
00:55
And in brackets you pass the arguments that you want to. 
00:59
Let's have a look at it how it looks practically.
01:03
So we've defined.
01:05
A simple class here it's called methods. 
01:08
Let's define a function here public.
01:12
Static.
01:16
Let's return into. 
01:17
This time we'll return integer type. 
01:20
It's called add. 
01:22
The functions name is add then.
01:26
String.
01:29
Argument.
01:35
Now further sorry you don't you'll pass on the arguments like int A as we are adding 2SO2 variables int AEA&B return.
01:51
A+.
01:53
B. 
01:53
So you are returning it. 
01:55
What we've done here is this is a class. 
01:58
This is a function that I've defined in that class. 
02:01
Its name is add. 
02:02
OK for now, it won't do anything because we are not calling it anywhere. 
02:07
We are not utilizing it. 
02:08
We are not using it, but when we call it, that is when it will work.
02:14
So let's see.
02:17
Let's create the main function. 
02:19
That's where the execution starts from.
02:33
So what we'll do here is we are simply going to.
02:37
Call this function, it says.
02:42
Let's define a variable should be C Now when we call this function.
02:51
Add we'll pass arguments.
02:56
We passed 22.
02:59
Plus 22.
03:04
So it should return 44.
03:07
So these two arguments, let me just make it a little different. 
03:11
Okay? 
03:11
42 should be the answer. 
03:13
22 goes into A, 20 goes into B. 
03:16
The return word is used in the brackets. 
03:20
We pass whatever we want to return here, so the return would be 42. 
03:25
So C should be equal.
03:27
42 here, then we just print the result.
03:53
So there you go.
03:55
Compiled.
03:57
Let's check what's the output.
04:01
The output is. 
04:03
The sum is 42. 
04:04
So what happened here is that we had a class. 
04:09
We've defined 2 functions. 
04:10
One is the one that adds 2 numbers and returns the sum. 
04:16
We called it here In this way, these arguments are called actual.
04:21
Parameters. 
04:22
These are called formal parameters. 
04:24
You make sure you define the data type here so everything goes smooth. 
04:30
Now let's give it another try. 
04:32
Now let's try something different. 
04:34
What if I try to call it?
04:39
Outside this class. 
04:40
So the class is public, the method is public. 
04:45
Let's try it. 
04:46
OK, let's create another class Create. 
04:49
Let's create it. 
04:51
Here I'm gonna call it.
04:55
Umm.
04:58
Let's call it main.
05:02
And you should notice something that this main and that main are different. 
05:07
Java is.
05:09
Case sensitive. 
05:10
So this mean with starting with a capital letter is different from the other one. 
05:16
OK So what I did here is I pasted the same code. 
05:20
We are trying to call the add function but it shows us an error. 
05:26
It says undeclared method. 
05:27
We do not recognize it.
05:29
We don't know what you're talking about. 
05:32
AD is not a function here. 
05:34
Now what we do about it. 
05:36
So like I told you.
05:39
So as you can see.
05:44
As you can see, this is a different class. 
05:47
This is a different class.
05:50
So whenever we are trying to access members of another class, what we need to do is we'll create an object of that class. 
05:58
So the classes name was methods.
06:07
I'm giving it a name, I'll call it OB now new.
06:15
Methods.
06:18
So I have.
06:20
Created.
06:23
An object.
06:26
Now, when I need to call any member of this class methods that we defined earlier, I'll use the object.
06:38
OB dot whatever is the name of the object, whatever is it, you'll use that. 
06:44
Now let's compile it and it should run. 
06:47
Yes, it compiles. 
06:48
Now one thing you can see here that the main function got connected with the main class got connected with the methods function.
06:58
So a function that's defined in the methods class is being used in the main class, here the add function. 
07:06
As we can see there is no method defined here that is called add, but it is defined in the methods class. 
07:16
So keeping it simple.
07:18
Let's execute it and we want the answer to be 42. 
07:23
We are executing the main class not the other one. 
07:27
The answer remains same that sum is 42 just in case you not.
07:35
Selected this option Clear screen at method call. 
07:38
You might be getting new new outputs with the previous ones still on the console, so you can select this. 
07:47
I think it's pretty late to tell you that, but yes. 
07:51
So clear screen at method calls sometimes by default.
07:55
The screen won't be cleared by the while we execute it. 
08:01
The previous outputs would still be visible. 
08:04
So just select this option. 
08:07
OK yes. 
<---------------------Video8------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello students so we are going to start our course here which is known as basics of Java.
00:10
So you will be learning basic concepts of Java, how to write a program in Java, perform in various perform various tasks in Java. 
00:20
Before we dive into it, let's start with what Java is exactly. 
00:25
So Java is an object oriented programming language. 
00:28
What we mean by.
00:30
Object Oriented programming language. 
00:32
We'll definitely discuss it just in a bit. 
00:35
But just you should know that Java is an object oriented programming language. 
00:40
There are various other object oriented programming languages. 
00:43
For example, C is one of the examples. 
00:46
Now where do we use Java? 
00:48
Java is used to make Android applications it.
00:51
We used to make web applications mobile games, so it is employed at various.
00:58
Places it's employed in various projects Now a little bit of the history of Java. 
01:05
It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1990. 
01:08
It was originally known as Oak. 
01:11
Later on its name was changed to Java, which was I think based on name of a coffee.
01:19
OK, now let's understand when we say Java is an object oriented programming language, what do we mean exactly? 
01:27
So here there are various basic concepts of Java. 
01:31
But here two major concepts of Java object in the class. 
01:36
Well an object is an instance of class.
01:40
By instance of a classmate we mean that it is just like an example of a class. 
01:46
And what is a class? 
01:47
A class is a blueprint of an object.
01:51
Or just like you can say that a class is just like a template, so a template which can be used to create various objects. 
02:02
So class is a general template of a thing and we can create various objects of it now for example here.
02:11
You can see that a vehicle vehicle is the class here example. 
02:14
Just taking it as an example from our real life. 
02:18
So when we say a vehicle, vehicle has vehicle could be any, it could be an airplane, it could be a train, it could be a car, bus, scooter, any of these. 
02:28
So here we have taken a few examples.
02:31
So here we cycle is a class. 
02:34
So a vehicle will have its own functionality. 
02:37
We know a vehicle can have a maximum speed. 
02:41
Each and every vehicle would have a maximum speed, minimum speed. 
02:46
It will have various other features. 
02:48
How many wheels it has, what?
02:51
Color it is. 
02:52
So all these things come under a vehicle. 
02:56
A vehicle would have some properties. 
02:59
Now when we go in deeper, we'll see a car is the type of a vehicle. 
03:06
Now here we'll see that a car has its own specific details, OK.
03:12
One could be red in color. 
03:14
It has four wheels. 
03:16
Its maximum speed is 120 kilometer per hour. 
03:19
Similarly, a bus has its own properties. 
03:22
A scooter, it has two wheels rather than four. 
03:26
So it has its own properties, but all of them have wheels. 
03:31
OK, so a general.
03:32
Template. 
03:33
A general way of calling them would be a Vehicle. 
03:37
So Vehicle here is a class and all these are its objects.
03:43
No.
03:45
Moving further, what's the difference between an object in a class? 
03:49
You do not have to worry about it if you do not understand it. 
03:53
Now when we do practice it practically while we are coding, you will definitely understand it. 
03:59
So do not worry about it now. 
04:01
Here, just like we discussed, an object is an instance of class.
04:06
A class is a collection of objects, so we can either call it a collection of objects or we can call it a blueprint of an object.
04:14
We can create multiple objects of a single class. 
04:17
So we can also term it as collection of objects. 
04:21
Now as the class is just a template so it does not take up any space on the memory. 
04:28
Whereas when it comes to an object whenever we create an object of a class.
04:34
It does take up space on the memory. 
04:37
Now taking it simply how when it comes to the coding part. 
04:41
So how do we declare a class? 
04:43
How we create a class? 
04:45
So a class starts with class keyword. 
04:47
Then you will give it a name. 
04:50
You can give it any name. 
04:52
I've given it my class, that's the name.
04:55
Then curly brackets open. 
04:56
The content will be included in these curly brackets. 
05:00
That is how we will define a class. 
05:03
Now of the same class, whenever we want to create an object, first of all the name of the class. 
05:10
Whichever class it is, its name would go here. 
05:13
Then object you can give it.
05:16
Any name I've given it obj equal to new. 
05:19
Now new keyword is used here. 
05:22
Then my class again the name of the name of the class round brackets; Make sure you put a semi colon here. 
05:31
There are statements in Java where you have to put I think most of the statements.
05:37
Need a semi colon so you might write a whole code. 
05:41
It's all good, no errors. 
05:43
But a semi colon might cause an issue and you might not be able to execute it. 
05:49
So make sure you put a semi colon there. 
05:52
So that is the basic difference between a class and object, OK?
<---------------------Video9------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
OK, let's have a look at these jump statements. 
00:04
Now break. 
00:05
We've already seen in the switch case, but we'll just go over it again and continue. 
00:11
These are two jump statements that help us jump from one line of code to the other while the execution is still on.
00:22
So here we have a class, simply we've named it Jump State.
00:28
Let's define a for loop here int I.
00:45
So in normal execution, we'll try.
01:02
We are printing eye here.
01:05
So now simply let's see what it does. 
01:08
So as we've already done it in the loop, it will print numbers zero to 10.
01:16
But now I want to show you how to use. 
01:20
What does a break statement do?
01:23
So if.
01:28
I is equal equal to 5.
01:33
Then.
01:35
Break.
01:38
So what a break statement would do is in case this block is executed, the control from this line would come out of the loop, which means the loop would be terminated. 
01:53
Let's see, although this loop should loop should go on.
01:58
Until it it prints zero to 10. 
02:01
Let's see what happens when we add a break statement here.
02:07
So there you go, 01234 and five. 
02:12
So what happened here is when?
02:16
It was equal to five this statement, this block of code was executed and the control came out of the loop. 
02:26
So it never went back and checked these got incremented or checked the condition to iterate again. 
02:34
No, it was terminated.
02:36
Let's see what a continue statement does so now.
02:42
Working of break statement and a continuous statement are similar but.
02:49
How does it differ?
02:51
Can you notice something here?
02:54
There's something missing 5 is missing here. 
02:58
Why?
03:01
The continuous statement works similar to the break statement. 
03:05
Whenever it's executed, it terminates the loop.
03:09
But sorry, it does not terminate the loop, rather it ignores whatever is after it for one time. 
03:19
So when it was 5, continuous statement was executed and what happened is this line right here was ignored.
03:29
And the iteration and it moves to the next iteration. 
03:35
That is how it works. 
03:38
Breaks statements, simply terminates the loop continuous statement.
03:44
Ignores the part of a loop, a block of set after it, and continues with the next iteration. 
03:52
Whereas that is not true for a break statement. 
03:56
Break statement completely terminates it and never goes back.
<---------------------Video10------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
So now here we'll understand what are packages in Java. 
00:07
Well packages in Java are a collection of similar classes, interfaces and sub packages. 
00:14
For now you can just take it as these are a collection of classes functions.
00:22
Which can be used now. 
00:24
These are of two types.
00:27
Built in and user defined. 
00:29
So built in packages are those that are already loaded in the compiler in the JDK and you can just use them.
00:39
You don't have to define them, you don't have to define a function, you don't have to define what task this has to perform. 
00:48
You can just import it and use it, as simple as that. 
00:52
And user defined packages are those, We can Group A few classes and we can name it as a package.
01:00
Those are called user defined packages. 
01:03
Now we have a few examples of built-in packages. 
01:07
The examples here are Java dot IO. 
01:11
Now it includes various classes. 
01:14
I've mentioned a few classes here, buffer, reader, input stream, output stream.
01:20
So these are all used while taking an input. 
01:23
Then we have Java Lang. 
01:25
It is a default package, by which I mean that you do not have to import it or explicitly mention that I want to use this package and it's classes in my program. 
01:37
No, you don't have to. 
01:38
All these are already by default loaded.
01:42
Then we have Java dot util. 
01:45
Java dot util contains classes like a Scanner class. 
01:48
Scanner classes used to take input again then date, time zone. 
01:53
So whenever you want to use.
01:57
These kind of classes where you need the time zone and date of a user you can use Java dot util. 
02:06
Then we have Java dot SQL. 
02:08
So it basically like the name suggests SQL. 
02:11
So SQL is used for databases, so it's used for database connectivity.
02:17
We whenever we want to connect our Android or any other application to a database. 
02:24
That is when we use it the Java application whenever it needs the database connectivity. 
02:30
Now let's have a look at how to use these packages in our program.
02:39
Let's start with it. 
02:42
Now packages. 
02:43
So let's define a.
02:47
Class named package use. 
02:48
This is where we'll learn how to use the package.
02:54
So.
02:56
OK.
02:58
So we've defined it. 
03:00
Let's remove.
03:02
Comments and everything that we do not really need here.
03:12
OK.
03:33
So here we've defined it now just for an example.
03:39
Let's say we want to use the Scanner class here Scanner. 
03:44
I'll explain it further later on, but let's say Scanner. 
03:47
It's the name of the class like I told you how to create an object new.
03:56
Scanner here. 
03:57
We can. 
03:58
In the brackets we can pass an argument. 
04:01
We'll be passing system in so that whatever input we get, we get it. 
04:07
We get it to the Scanner class now.
04:11
Scanner class let let me try to use it.
04:15
Now when I'm trying to use it, it's showing me some suggestions and it's telling me that the package or the class, I'm sorry, the class has not been defined. 
04:26
So to do that, like we read earlier, it is present in Java util. 
04:31
So what we'll do is we'll use the keyword.
04:34
Import.
04:38
Then Java dot util dot*; Now when we compile it, it shows no syntax errors, although it won't do anything. 
04:49
We've just created an object and done nothing.
04:55
But this is how it works. 
04:58
So what do we mean by this* So what it does is it will import all the classes that are present in the Java util package. 
05:09
So all the classes be it Scanner class be it any other class.
05:15
It will import it, but just in case we just want a single class, we don't want to use any other we can after the dot, we can just write that single class's name as well. 
05:29
It won't show us any error as we just want to use a specific class from this package.
05:36
So this is how you import any package. 
<---------------------Video11------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
start_time,end_time,text
0.0,8.7,"Now moving further as we have already understood three types of operators arithmetic, relational"
8.7,9.7,and logical.
9.7,15.38,"Now let us move on to assignment operators, one of which we have already used a simple"
15.38,18.1,equal to we have already used.
18.1,24.54,We can let us understand what are the other operators that have been mentioned in the assignment
24.54,25.54,operator.
25.54,27.54,So let us see.
28.54,35.78,"So simply here we can see that a is equal to 12, that means that 12 is the value of"
35.78,36.78,a.
36.78,41.94,Now we have a different way of overwriting it.
41.94,46.06,So we can overwrite it simply as a is equal to 9.
46.06,54.74,"So now when we try to print a, it will show us 9 rather than 12."
54.74,63.34,So like I said earlier that it raises the previous value now the value of a is 9 as we
63.34,65.46,have printing a.
65.46,71.3,Now let us suppose we want to add a number to a.
71.3,75.7,We want a is equal to a plus 5.
75.7,84.7,Now what do we mean by this that here the result will be as per 12 plus 5.
84.7,93.9,So now a new value would be assigned to a which would be 12 which is a plus 5.
93.9,98.22,12 plus 5 would be 18.
98.22,102.22,Let us compile it.
102.22,108.06,So are we 17 it will be 17.
108.06,112.46,So it has successfully added it.
112.46,121.18,Now rather than doing this what we can simply do is a plus equal to.
121.18,131.86,Now it will work in a similarly it is nothing but it is a is equal to a plus 5.
131.86,139.34,So no difference here we can write it as this or we can write it as this.
139.34,154.3,Now by let again no errors let us run it.
154.3,156.74,I think the terminal is open.
156.74,161.58,So no difference.
161.58,166.74,So that would be assignment operators.
166.74,173.62,So the other operators would also work in a similar way it will subtract multiply divide
173.62,176.3,finding modulus and everything.
176.3,180.5,Now next we have increment and decrement.
180.5,182.74,Let us have a look at this.
182.74,185.9,This is a very interesting operator.
185.9,188.1,So let us see.
188.1,196.7,Now here what I do is I simply write it is a unary operator means we can
196.7,202.38,use it with a single variable we do not need a bc equal to nothing.
202.38,210.9,Now a plus plus what this would do is it will increment the value by 1.
210.9,216.06,So it will add 1 to it.
216.06,220.42,Let us see just yeah.
220.42,223.98,Okay let us have a look at it.
224.02,231.42,So the original value was 12 it has incremented it to 13.
231.42,234.5,But there is a difference.
234.5,238.78,This is something that we need to understand.
238.78,246.54,We can write it as a plus plus or plus plus a.
246.54,249.18,It makes a difference.
249.18,253.74,Now what difference it makes is when we write plus plus a it
253.74,259.94,means that it will increment it increment the value right there and then.
259.94,263.22,So 12 here here the value is 13.
263.22,266.1,So when we print a it is 13.
266.1,276.26,But when we do a plus plus what it does is 12 still here the value is 12.
276.26,282.94,But when it is used the next time that is when the value would be 13.
282.94,285.22,Let me show you a difference.
285.22,294.18,So what I will do is rather than using it here to prove my point I am going to use it here
294.18,297.18,a plus plus.
297.18,306.06,Now let us see what would be the answer would it be 12 or 13 compile it.
306.06,311.18,Let us see.
311.42,314.26,12 still 12.
314.26,323.94,Now if we see it here if I do a plus plus a then compile it.
323.94,324.94,Okay.
324.94,326.94,We need another plus.
326.94,328.94,Okay plus plus a.
328.94,329.94,Okay.
329.94,339.42,If it shows an error here it is just because of the brackets as it is not able to differentiate
339.46,347.18,what is the arguments or what the plus exactly needs to combine just add the brackets here
347.18,348.18,that would help.
348.18,350.18,Okay compile.
350.18,356.7,Now plus plus a means it will do it right then and there it will increment it.
356.7,357.9,13.
357.9,369.38,Same goes for minus minus we use the subtraction sign here what it will do is.
369.38,371.38,The answer would be 11.
371.38,376.86,Now the last one the last one is conditional operator.
376.86,396.94,Now what is the conditional operator just commenting it here conditional operator is this one.
396.94,403.74,Now a question mark how do we use it well it is very interesting.
403.74,411.94,So what we do is let us take a let us just 12 and 9 simple.
411.94,415.3,Let us declare another variable call it result.
415.3,422.1,Now what it will do is it will compare these two and give us a result.
422.1,427.98,Now how result is equal to.
427.98,434.38,Now here is where the expression goes expression we can use the logical operators that
434.38,436.3,we have learned already.
436.3,446.1,A is if A is greater than B then question mark.
446.1,460.42,So we will add a question mark here then true otherwise a column forms.
460.42,470.42,So we need to put it in quotations.
470.42,477.7,Okay result.
477.7,483.54,So what we are doing is just a second.
483.54,498.74,Let us try and combine it.
498.74,509.9,Okay anyways so what we are doing here is if A is greater than B then A would go here.
509.9,517.3,If B is greater than 9 sorry B is greater which means it will return false then we will
517.3,519.58,have B here.
519.58,526.54,So what actually goes here is if the statement if this expression is true if the statement
526.54,534.1,is true then this part would be executed the one before the column if it is false then this
534.1,538.7,part would be executed which is the next part.
538.7,547.26,So now let us see.
547.26,556.98,So now what it does is which so ever number among A or B is the greatest the result would
556.98,558.34,be that.
558.34,566.18,So the bigger number when here the result should be 12 as per us as 12 is greater than
566.18,568.38,9 it should be 12.
568.38,581.06,Let us suppose B was some other number let us say it was 90.
581.06,586.9,Now in this case this expression would be false the second one should be printed the
586.9,593.34,result should contain the second one and the answer would be 90.
593.34,602.34,So these are the operators that we use we used all these operators are mathematical
602.34,608.58,operators relational logical assignment increment and conditional operators.
608.58,610.3,So all of these we understood.

In this project we explore the Wi-Fi capability of the ESP 32 and understand how it can be used for Internet of Things applications through wireless communication. 
00:16
The ESP 32 comes with built in Wi-Fi, allowing it to connect to a local wireless.
00:21
Network and exchange data with other devices First, the program initializes the Wi-Fi module by setting the Wi-Fi name and password so the ESP 32 can connect to the network. 
00:32
Once connected, the ESP 32 reads its assigned IP address and displays it on the OLED screen, making it easy for users to access the.
00:42
Device through a browser using the web page editing library. 
00:45
A simple control web interface is created where real time sensor values such as temperature can be displayed along with their units. 
00:53
Each value is linked to a unique card ID to avoid conflicts between modules. 
00:59
Web buttons are then added to the page.
01:02
Each assigned a specific function, like controlling an LED's or other external devices with unique card labels to separate their usage. 
01:10
These buttons allow users to send commands to the ESP 32 remotely through the web interface. 
01:16
After uploading the code, the OLED shows the IP address of the ESP 32.
01:22
When a computer or mobile phone connected to the same Wi-Fi network enters this IP address in a browser, the control page opens, allowing users to monitor data and control devices wirelessly.
01:33
This project demonstrates how ESP 32 can act as a powerful IoT controller, enabling real time monitoring and remote control through Wi-Fi, which is widely used in smart homes, automation systems and connected devices.
<------------------------Coding-Box video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->

In this project, we demonstrate a Wi-Fi real time display system using the ESP 32 to monitor multiple environmental sensor values on a web page.
00:16
The ESP 32 connects to a Wi-Fi network by initializing the Wi-Fi module with the network name and password, and once connected, it obtains an IP address which is displayed on the OLED screen for easy access.
00:29
At the same time, sensors such as the temperature and humidity sensor, pressure sensor using the BMP 388 module, photo resistor for light intensity, sound sensor, PIR motion sensor, and ultrasonic sensor are initialized and read continuously.
00:46
Each sensor value is updated in real time on a web page using dedicated web display blocks where every value is assigned a label and unit so it can be clearly identified.
00:57
The OLED serves as a local display to confirm successful Wi-Fi connection, while the web page allows remote monitoring.
01:04
After uploading the code, users connect their computer or mobile phone to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP 32 and enter the displayed IP address into a browser to view live sensor data.
01:15
If a mobile hotspot is used, the IP address can be accessed directly from the phone. 
01:22
This project highlights how ESP 32 can collect data from multiple sensors and publish it wirelessly in real time, making it highly useful for smart environment monitoring, IoT dashboards, and remote sensing applications.
<------------------------Coding-Box video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->

In this Wi-Fi piano project, we use the ESP 32 to create a simple online musical instrument that can be played through a web page. 
00:15
First the Wi-Fi module and the OLED display are initialized and once the ESP 32.
00:20
Connect to the Wi-Fi network. 
00:22
Its IP address is shown on the OLED so the user knows where to access the piano controls.

<---------------------Coding-Box video 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we demonstrate Wi-Fi based control of devices using the ESP 32, where an LED, a servo motor and a fan are controlled wirelessly through a web page.
00:17
1st, the Wi-Fi module and OLED display are initialized and after a successful connection, the ESP 32's IP address is shown on the OLED screen so the user can easily access the control page. 
00:29
For each device, a variable is created to store its current state, such as using a variable named rattle to represent whether the red.
00:37
LED is on or off on the web page. 
00:41
Individual buttons are added for controlling the red LED, yellow LED, green LED servo, and motor. 
00:47
When a button is pressed, the program checks the corresponding variable value using a condition block. 
00:53
If the value is 0, the device turns on and the variable is updated.
00:58
01 and if the value is already one, the device turns off and the variable is reset to 0. 
01:04
This toggle logic allows each button to switch the device state back and forth with every press. 
01:10
The same method is applied to control the servo movement and the fan motor. 
01:15
After uploading the code, the OLED displays the IP address.
01:18
And by connecting a computer or mobile phone to the same Wi-Fi network and entering the IP address in a browser, users can access the web interface and control all connected devices wirelessly, demonstrating a practical and easy to understand example of IoT based remote control using ESP 32.
<-------------------------Code-Box video 6 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this video, we are going to learn how to create a voice controlled lighting system that automatically turns on an LED when it detects sound in a dark environment. 
00:16
This project combines a sound sensor, a photo resistor and an LED.
00:20
To simulate a smart lighting control system similar to hallway or staircase lighting that turns on only when needed. 
00:26
The photo resistor ensures that the LED does not turn on during daytime or when the light level is already bright, which helps save energy.
00:35
The sound sensor detects the volume of noise in the environment and compares it to a preset threshold. 
00:41
When the sound is loud enough, for example a clap or someone speaking, the LED switches on for a few seconds and then turns off automatically. 
00:50
Let us understand how the code is built. 
00:52
First we drag and place the basic setup.
00:55
Blocks for reading the photoresistor and controlling the LED's. 
00:58
Next we add an if condition block to check the photo resistor value.
01:04
If the analog value is lower than a threshold such as 500, meaning it is dark, the program continues to the next condition. 
01:12
Inside the zip block. 
01:13
We add another if condition to check the sound sensor reading.
01:17
If the sound value goes above 200, meaning a detectable sound is made, the LED turns on. 
01:23
Then we insert a delay of five seconds so the LED stays lit for a short duration before turning off. 
01:29
Once the code is ready and uploaded, we can test the system.
01:35
If you make loud sounds under normal lighting conditions, the LED will not turn on because the photo resistor detects brightness and blocks the signal. 
01:43
However, if you cover the photo resistor to simulate darkness and then clap or speak loudly, the LED lights up for five seconds and then turns off automatically. 
01:53
This project demonstrates an excellent example of combining.
01:56
Two sensors to create smart automation and energy saving behavior.
02:01
It can be applied in hallways, staircases, bedrooms, parking areas and other places.
<-------------------------Code-Box video 7 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project, we build an Ultrasonic Ranger by combining an ultrasonic sensor with an OLED display to create a simple and effective distance measuring device that can detect objects in the range of about four to 300 centimeters to begin.
00:20
We prepare the basic initialization blocks so the program runs continuously, and then we initialize the OLED module to enable text display. 
00:28
Next, we set the OLED text size to 12 by 16 so the information is clearly visible on the screen. 
00:36
After that we declare A variable named distance and assign it the value detected.
00:41
By the ultrasonic sensor allowing the system to constantly update the measured distance in real time before displaying new data, we clear any existing content on the OLED to avoid overlapping text.
00:54
Then we add display blocks to show the label distance on the first line of the OLED screen, followed by the actual distance value on the second line, and finally add the unit CM after the number so the reading is easy to understand. 
01:07
To make sure the displayed information updates properly, we include an OLED refresh block at the end of the loop.
01:14
Once the code is uploaded, the OLED screen immediately begins showing the distance detected by the ultrasonic sensor, updating continuously as objects move closer or farther away. 
01:24
This project demonstrates how ultrasonic sensors can be used for accurate distance measurement and how an OLED module can present sensor data, clearly making it a useful foundation.
01:35
For applications such as obstacle detection, parking assistants, robotics, and smart measuring tools.
<---------------------Code-box video 8 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this smart control panel project, we use the ESP 32's built-in Wi-Fi feature to create an intelligent web-based control system that can both control devices and display sensor data wirelessly. 
00:18
First, the Wi-Fi module.
00:20
OLED display are initialized and once the ESP 32 connects to the Wi-Fi network, its IP address is shown on the OLED screen so the user can easily access the control panel. 
00:31
On the web page. 
00:32
Different display cards are created to show real time values from connected modules such as sensors, allowing users to monitor environmental.
00:40
Our system data remotely. 
00:41
Along with this, multiple web buttons are defined and each button is assigned to specific functions such as turning LED S on or off, controlling A servo motor, or operating other connected modules. 
00:54
When a button is pressed on the web interface, the ESP 32 receives the command instantly and performs the assigned.
01:01
Action demonstrating real time wireless control. 
01:03
After uploading the program, any mobile phone or computer connected to the same Wi-Fi network can open a browser, enter the displayed IP address and access the Smart Control panel where both device control and live data monitoring are combined into a single, easy to use interface.
01:21
Clearly showing how ESP 32 can be used to build practical IoT control systems.
<---------------------Code-box video 9 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project, we create a creative and informal RGB ring clock that uses an RGB LED ring to represent time through colors, where red indicates the hour, green shows the minute, and blue displays the seconds and because the ring.
00:20
12 LEDs. 
00:21
Each bead represents A5 second or five minute interval, making the clock simple yet visually appealing. 
00:27
We start the build by preparing the basic blocks, initializing the serial port at 9600 baud and setting up the RGB ring module. 
00:37
Then we declare 3 variables named our minute.
00:40
And 2nd assigning them initial values like 10/30/40. 
00:43
After this basic setup we create a custom function called clock code which handles the entire time counting logic. 
00:51
Inside this function we increment the second value every second and check if seconds reach 60. 
00:57
If they do we reset seconds to 0.
01:00
And increase the minute by 1. 
01:02
Similarly if minutes reach 60 we reset them and increase the hour, and if hours exceed 12 we roll them back to 1.
01:11
With this logical structure, the clock stays in the standard 12 hour format. 
01:15
We then add a one second delay to ensure real time counting and print the updated time values on the serial monitor for reference.
01:24
After the time tracking part, we start programming the RGB ring to display the time visually. 
01:29
For the seconds, we check whether 2nd modulo 5 = 0. 
01:33
If it is 0, the 12th bead lights up and for all other values we light the bead corresponding to 2nd slash 5 -, 1 with blue representing seconds.
01:44
The same idea is applied to minutes, but without the clear block condition, and green LED's represent the minutes. 
01:51
For the hours, we directly map the hour value to the bead number using hour one, since 1:00 to 12:00 corresponds neatly to beads 0 to 11 and these are displayed in red. 
02:02
Finally, after preparing all timing and.
02:04
LED mapping logic. 
02:05
We refresh the RGB ring so that the correct bead lights up for each unit of time. 
02:11
Once the code is uploaded and an initial time is entered, the RGB ring begins functioning like a colorful analog clock, with blue completing a full circle every minute, green showing minute progress, and red marking our positions.
02:25
When colors overlap, only one is visible depending on priority, maintaining clarity. 
02:30
Although this project doesn't use a real time clock chip, it still serves as an excellent demonstration of how to combine LED's variables arithmetic.
<---------------------Code-box video 10 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project, we learn how to control a servo motor using the X axis of a joystick, a method commonly used in real applications such as remotely opening or closing doors and switching mechanical devices on or off to build this.
00:20
Rogram We start with the basic initialization blocks, so the system runs continuously. 
00:24
Then we declare A variable named angle and assign it the X axis value read from the joystick, which changes depending on whether the joystick is moved left or right.
00:36
Inside the main loop, we use conditional logic to check the value of angle. 
00:41
When the joystick is pushed to the right, the X axis value becomes very high, typically greater than 3500, and under this condition the servo rotates to 0°. 
00:51
When the joystick is pushed to the left, the X axis value becomes.
00:56
Very low, usually less than 500, and in this case the servo rotates to 180°.
01:03
These two conditions allow the servo to respond directly to joystick movement, creating a simple and effective remote control system. 
01:10
After uploading the completed code, you can test the project by moving the joystick left and right. 
01:16
Pushing it to the left causes the servo to rotate to 180°, while pushing it to the right makes the servo.
01:24
Rotate back to 0°.
01:27
This project demonstrates how analog joystick input can be converted into precise mechanical motion, and it helps you understand the relationship between sensor readings, variables, conditional statements, and servo motor control, and practical automation and robotics applications.
<---------------------Code-box video 11 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Intrusion alarm is a security system designed to detect unauthorized entry into a protected area and alert people immediately. 
00:13
It is commonly used in homes, shops, warehouses, supermarkets, and many other places to ensure safety of people.
00:20
Property In this project, Air motion sensor is used to sense human movement. 
00:26
When the system is powered on, the sensor continuously monitors the surroundings.
00:33
If any motion is detected, the PIR sensor outputs a high value which activates the alarm system.
00:40
As a result, the speaker starts sounding an alert, the red LED turns on to indicate danger and the green LED turns off when there is no movement. 
00:49
The P IR sensor outputs a low value, the speaker remains silent, the red LED stays off, and the green LED turns on to show normal condition. 
00:59
This intrusion.
01:00
Alarm system provides a simple and effective way to monitor restricted areas and improve security.
<------------------------Code-box video 12 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project, we create a human body piano that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of your hand and place different musical notes based on how far your hand is from the sensor, turning your hand movements into a fun and interactive piano.
00:21
The system includes an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, A variable named distance to store the detected value, and a speaker to play the tones.
00:30
To build the code manually, start with a when green flag clicked block and add a forever loop so the sensor continuously reads the distance.
00:39
Then assign the ultrasonic sensor value to the distance variable.
00:43
Next, use a series of IF conditions to check different distance ranges. 
00:48
If the distance is between 5 to 10 centimeters play due between 10 to 15 centimeters play RE, 15 to 20 centimeters play ME, 20 to 25 centimeters play FA, 25 to 30 centimeters play SO 30 to 35 centimeters play LA.
01:04
And 35 to 40 centimeters play C.
01:08
Duplicate the same structure for all 7 notes, adjusting the distance conditions accordingly. 
01:12
And finally add a block to stop the tone when your hand moves out of the note ranges.
01:18
Once uploaded, place your hand in front of the sensor and slowly move it closer or farther to play different tones.
01:25
The speaker responds instantly, allowing you to create melodies, experiment with rhythm, or slide your hand to produce a smooth musical scale.
01:34
This project helps you learn how ultrasonic sensors, variables, loops, and conditional statements work together, making it both educational and fun. 
01:42
It's a great example of how coding and music can combine to create an engaging STEM activity, and you can even extend it later by adding LED's or display screens to enhance the experience.
<------------------------Code-box video 13 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this video tutorial, we will learn how to create a mini environment monitoring device that displays temperature, humidity, air pressure, and altitude using an OLED screen. 
00:16
We begin by building the two basic setup blocks and then initialize.
00:20
Built the BMP 388 sensor and the OLED display. 
00:24
Next we add a string block to set the required parameters. 
00:28
After that we read the BMP 388 sensor values and start displaying information on the OLED.
00:36
On the first line, we center the text data Suggs by setting the cursor to around X = 30. 
00:42
Then we set the display position starting from y = 10 and add 3 OLED display blocks. 
00:48
The first block shows T for temperature in mill warp mode, the next block displays the actual temperature value, and the third block shows the unit.
00:57
See in warp mode we duplicate this structure to display humidity where the first line shows our H.
01:04
The second line shows the humidity value and the third line displays the unit per cent. 
01:09
We repeat the same steps again for air pressure, using P on the first line, the pressure value on the second line, and the unit HPA on the third line. 
01:20
Finally, we duplicate once more for altitude, starting with ASL on the 1st.
01:25
The altitude value on the second line and the unit M on the third line.
01:30
To finish the project, we add an OLED refresh block and a one second delay so the values update smoothly. 
01:38
After uploading the complete code, the OLED display will continuously show real time temperature, humidity, air pressure and altitude, turning your setup into a compact environmental monitoring device.
<------------------------Code-box video 14 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project, we create a digital compass using the AK-8975 magnetic sensor and an OLED display to visually indicate direction with arrows. 
00:15
First, the program begins with the basic initialization blocks, so the system.
00:20
Runs continuously. 
00:21
We then initialize both the AKA 8975 Compass module and the OLED display and declare A variable named direction to store the heading value measured by the sensor inside the loop. 
00:33
The OLED screen is cleared to ensure a clean display and the direction value read from the AK-8975.
00:40
Module is assigned to the direction variable based on this value. 
00:45
Conditional blocks are used to determine which arrows should be displayed on the OLED. 
00:51
When the direction value is between 3:40 and 360°, an upward arrow is shown indicating N if the direction falls between 230.
01:00
And 250°, a right arrow appears representing E When the direction value is between 1:40 and 170°, a downward arrow is displayed indicating South and if the direction is between 70 and 90°, a left arrow appears representing W after selecting the.
01:21
Direct Arrow, An OLED refresh block updates the display and a short delay of half a second is added to ensure smooth and stable readings.
01:30
Once the code is uploaded, the OLED arrow initially points close to the self direction and as the coding box is rotated, the arrow changes accordingly, clearly showing real time directional movement. 
01:41
This project demonstrates how a magnetic sensor can be used for compass applications and how sensor data can be converted into intuitive visual indicators.
01:50
Making it useful for navigation systems, robotics and orientation based projects. 

<--------------------------Code-box video 15 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we create a mini car backing radar that works just like the reversing sensors used in real vehicles, using an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance behind the car, a traffic light LED module for visual alerts and a speaker.
00:20
For sound warnings.
00:22
We begin by building the basic coding blocks and then declare A variable named distance which stores the value detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
00:31
The program continuously updates this value so the system always knows how far the obstacle is. 
00:37
Next, we add a condition to check if the distance is greater than 40 centimeters. 
00:42
If it is, the system shows a safe situation by turning on the green LED's, keeping the red LED off, and making sure the speaker stays silent.
00:51
Then we add another condition for when the distance is less than 40 centimeters.
00:57
In this case, the system recognizes danger, so the red LED turns on, the green LED turns off, and the speaker starts beeping to warn that an obstacle is too close. 
01:08
After uploading the program, testing becomes very simple. 
01:10
When the sensor detects a larger safe distance, only the green light glows and no sound is produced.
01:17
But when something approaches too closely, the warning light and alarm activate immediately.
01:23
This project clearly demonstrates how ultrasonic sensing, conditional logic and output modules work together to create a real world safety device. 
01:31
It shows how the ultrasonic sensor acts like the eyes, constantly checking for objects, while the LED's and speaker act like the signals and voice that guide the user.
01:43
Even though this is a small scale model, it works on the same principle used in modern cars to avoid collisions while reversing, making it an excellent beginner friendly example of applying sensors and programming to solve real problems effectively.
<--------------------------Code-box video 16 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we create a button controlled fan system where the fan turns on or off depending on which button is pressed, using an add key input to read different analog values from each button. 
00:17
To build the code manually, we start with the basic setup.
00:21
Blocks the when green flag clicked block and a forever loop, so the fan continuously responds to button presses. 
00:27
Next we create a variable named item and inside the loop we assign the analog value from the AD key sensor to this variable.
00:37
The AD key module gives different analog readings for different buttons. 
00:40
So we use an if else condition to read these values and decide what the fan should do if the value of item is greater than 3500, which corresponds to pressing the red button. 
00:52
We stop the fan by setting both motor pins low if the value is between 2030.
00:58
Which corresponds to pressing the yellow button. 
01:00
We activate the fan by making the motor rotate.
01:04
These conditions allow the system to instantly react to whichever button the user presses. 
01:09
After deciding the fan state. 
01:11
We add a short delay of around 0.3 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in readings and make the button response smooth once uploaded to the board, Pressing the yellow button makes the fan spin and pressing the red button.
01:24
Turns it off, showing how simple button inputs can be used to control real hardware.
01:30
This activity teaches how analog key modules work, how to read sensor values, and how conditions and motor control instructions together can create an efficient interactive device. 
01:40
It's a fun introduction to digital input control and a practical demonstration of using buttons to manage electrical appliances in a safe and programmable way.
<------------------------Code-box video 17 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this video tutorial, we will learn how to create an automatic fan system that works using both temperature sensing and motion detection to save energy.
00:15
During hot summer days, many public places use auto fans that turn on only when the surrounding temperature becomes too high. 
00:21
In this project, we will enhance that idea by adding a PIR motion sensor so the fan will run only when the temperature crosses the threshold and a person is detected nearby.
00:33
1st we create the basic setup blocks and then we declare A variable named temp. 
00:38
Next we read the temperature sensor value and assign it to the temp variable so the program can continuously check the environment.
00:46
Then we add an if else block to compare the temperature value with the set limit such as 28°.
00:52
If the value is higher, the program proceeds to the next condition. 
00:56
If not, the fan remains off. 
00:58
After that we add another if else block to read the P IR sensor.
01:04
If the par value is 1, meaning motion is detected, the fan turns on.
01:09
Otherwise it remains off after uploading the complete test code. 
01:14
The system works automatically whenever the temperature rises above 28° and the PIR sensor detects someone the fan starts were tating.
01:23
If either condition is not met, temperature too low, or no motion detected, the fan stays off, ensuring efficient and smart energy usage.
<------------------------------code-box video 18 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this activity, we create an automatic door system similar to those found in malls, where the door opens when a person approaches and closes when no one is near by. 
00:16
To build this program, we start with the basic initialization blocks.
00:20
Using the green flag and a forever loop to make sure the system keeps checking for movement.
00:25
Inside the loop we add a condition block to read the output of the PIR motion sensor.
00:31
This sensor detects infrared radiation from human bodies, and it outputs one when someone is present and 0 when the area is clear. 
00:40
Based on this reading, we control a servo motor that represents the door. 
00:45
When the PR sensor detects motion, the servo rotates to 180°, which simulates the door opening.
00:52
When no motion is detected, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door.
00:58
By continuously evaluating the sensor values, the door responds automatically to people approaching and leaving.
01:05
After uploading the code, simply wave your hand in front of the PIR sensor and the servo turns to 180°, opening the door. 
01:13
As soon as the center no longer detects movement, the servo slowly returns.
<--------------------------------------Code-box video 19 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we create a simple access control system using an RFID module, a magnetic or IC card and a servo motor to simulate a real access door.
00:17
The idea is that when the correct card is scanned, the door opens automatically and if the card is not recognized, the door stays locked.
00:25
To build the program, we begin with the basic start and forever blocks, so the system constantly checks for a card.
00:32
We initialize the RFID module so it can read card data, and then we create a string variable called ID card that stores the correct card code. 
00:40
Each user will have a different code, so you must replace the sample code with the one read from your own card. 
00:47
Inside the forever loop, we use a condition that compares the scanned RFID code with the stored.
00:53
ID card value.
00:55
If the scanned code matches, it means the card is authorized and the servo rotates to 180° representing the door opening.
01:04
The servo holds this position for three seconds to allow the person to enter. 
01:08
After the delay, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door again. 
01:13
If the scant card does not match the stored code, the condition fails and the servo remains at 0°, indicating that the door is locked and access is denied.
01:24
After uploading the program, simply place your card near the RFID sensor. 
01:28
If it is the correct card, the servo will smoothly rotate to open the door and then return to the closed position.
01:36
If the card is incorrect, nothing happens demonstrating reliable and secure access control.
01:42
This experiment clearly shows how RFID technology, variables and conditional logic can work together to build real world security systems similar to those used in offices, apartments and commercial buildings.
<------------------------------Code-box video 20 ------------------------------------------------------------------->\
In this video tutorial, we are going to learn how to build an automatic window closing system that reacts to changes in light. 
00:13
This project uses a photo resistor as a light sensor and a servo motor to open and close the window.
00:20
The idea behind the project is simple. 
00:23
When the surrounding environment becomes dark, the system should automatically close the window for safety and energy efficiency. 
00:29
The photo resistor plays a key role in detecting light intensity because its resistance changes according to the ambient light level. 
00:37
We set a threshold value that determines when the window.
00:41
Would close if the analog value of the photo resistor drops below this threshold, meaning the environment is dark, the servo rotates to 180°, simulating the closing of the window. 
00:53
Otherwise, when the value is higher than the threshold indicating daylight or sufficient brightness, the servo returns to 0°.
01:01
Opening the window now, let's discuss the block coding process. 
01:05
We begin by placing the basic initialization blocks for reading the photo resistor and controlling the servo motor. 
01:12
Then we insert an IF condition block to compare the analog input value. 
01:17
Inside the if section, we add the servo control block and set the rotation.
01:22
The 180° for the dark condition. 
01:24
In the L section, we again add the servo block and set its rotation to 0° for the bright condition. 
01:31
After completing the code and uploading it, we can test the system by covering the photo resistor with our hand or any object. 
01:39
When the light decreases, the threshold is crossed.
01:42
And the servo rotates to 180°, closing the window. 
01:46
When the cover is removed and the analog value becomes higher than the threshold, the servo moves back to 0°, opening the window again. 
01:55
This automatic window system demonstrates an excellent real world application of sensors and actuators, showing how automation can improve.
02:03
Everyday life.

Sound Sensor Overview The sound sensor contains a high sensitivity microphone and an LM358 operational amplifier. 
00:14
The microphone captures weak sound signals. 
00:17
These signals are then amplified by the.
00:20
LM358 so the output becomes clear and easy to detect. 
00:25
Because of its high sensitivity and fast response, this sensor is widely used in sound detection and recognition tasks. 
00:34
It provides a stable and reliable sound input for many intelligent devices.
00:40
Code blocks One board rate block. 
00:43
This block sets the board rate. 
00:46
Common values are 9600 or 115,200. 
00:50
In this project, the board rate is set to 9602. 
00:55
Print block. 
00:56
This block prints information on the serial monitor.
01:00
It supports 3 modes, warp, no warp and hexadecimal warp is the default printing mode 3 sound reading block. 
01:08
This block reads the analog value of the sound detected by the sensor manually building the blocks. 
01:16
Follow the images and assemble the blocks in the correct order.
01:21
Step one. 
01:22
Open the coding software, go to File and select Load from your computer.

Choose the file you previously downloaded if needed or start with a new file. 
01:33
Step 2. 
01:34
Add the block when Arduino begin. 
01:36
Step three from the serial category, drag the block Serial 0.
01:41
Again baudrate 9600. 
01:43
Place it under the Arduino Begin block. 
01:46
Step 4 Add a forever block from the control section. 
01:50
Step 5 Inside the forever block placed the serial print block. 
01:55
It should appear as serial zero Print Hello kids block warp. 
02:00
This text will later.
02:01
Be replaced by the sound value. 
02:04
Step 6 From the sound category, drag the block that reads the value of sound. 
02:09
Place it inside the print block where the text content normally goes. 
02:14
It should now look like serial zero print. 
02:17
Read the value of sound IO34 warp complete. 
02:20
Test code the complete.
02:22
Mark structure should be when Arduino begins serial zero, begin baudrate 9600 forever Serial zero print. 
02:29
Read the value of sound IO34 warp test results. 
02:34
Upload the code to the board. 
02:37
Open the serial monitor. 
02:39
Set the board rate to 9600.
02:42
Before starting, you will see a continuous stream of numbers. 
02:46
These numbers represent the analog sound values detected by the sensor.
<------------------------------Code-box video 22 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this video tutorial we will learn about the 9 gram servo motor, its working principle, wiring and how to control it using block coding. 
00:16
A9 gram servo is a small but powerful motor used in robotics.
00:20
Projects for its high precision and good torque. 
00:24
It can rotate up to 180° and operates with low noise. 
00:28
The servo has three wires. 
00:30
The brown wire is G&D connected to ground. 
00:34
The red wire is VCC connected to five volts or 3.3 volts power supply and the orange.
00:41
Wire is the signal pin which receives PWM pulse width modulation signals to control the rotation angle. 
00:48
The servo angle is determined by the pulse width, where one millisecond rotates the servo to 0° and two milliseconds rotates it to 180°. 
00:58
Now let us move to coating first place.
01:01
Servo control block and set the degree to zero and delay to two seconds. 
01:07
Duplicate the block and change the angle to 90° and again duplicate to change the angle to 180°. 
01:14
Finally duplicate once more to bring the servo back to 0. 
01:18
After uploading the servo will rotate to zero 90 and 180°.
01:22
Each staying for two seconds and then repeat. 
01:26
For the extension activity, we gradually rotate the servo from zero to 180 using a repeat block set to 180. 
01:34
Then place the servo angle block inside and increase the degree step by step with a delay of 10 milliseconds.
01:43
Duplicate this block and change the increase to decrease to move the servo back from 180 to 0. 
01:51
When the code is uploaded, the servo will smoothly rotate forward and backward continuously. 
01:57
Servo motors are widely used in robotic arms, grippers, steering mechanisms, aircraft models, and many mechanical.
02:04
Systems.

388 Pressure sensor is a neumatic MEMS sensor designed in a compact package with small size, low power consumption and high performance. 
00:17
It combines both temperature and pressure.
00:22
Portable and mobile applications.
00:25
This module adopts proven piezo resistive pressure sensing technology which provides high accuracy, good linearity, long term stability and excellent electromagnetic interference resistance. 
00:39
It offers great flexibility when working with multiple devices and.
00:45
Is widely used.
00:49
Wearable devices, smart home systems, and other consumer electronics. 
00:54
It can be optimized further to improve power consumption, resolution and filtering performance based on piezoelectric pressure sensing technology, the BMP 380.
01:08
8 measures air pressure and temperature accurately. 
01:12
It can measure pressure ranging from 300 to 1250 hectopascals while consuming very low power only 3.4 micro amperes at A1 Hertz operating frequency. 
01:26
The built in.
01:28
Infinite Impulse response filter helps reduce external interference effects and ensures smooth readings. 
01:35
Now let us build the test code manually. 
01:40
First, drag the block to initialize the BMP 388 pressure sensor. 
01:45
Without this block the module.
01:48
Will not operate. 
01:50
Next, use the block that reads the BMP 388 sensor values so that pressure, altitude and temperature data can be collected. 
02:00
Then go to the serial section and find the block to begin board rate. 
02:07
Set the baud rate.
02:09
To 9600 and place this block under the start block. 
02:13
Now add a forever loop and inside it add a print block. 
02:17
Set it to print pressure in no warp mode and place the read pressure data after it.
02:25
Duplicate the print block to display altitude and modify it to show altitude values. 
02:31
Duplicate again and set it to rint temperature and modify it to show the temperature value in degrees Celsius. 
02:39
Finally change the last print block to war mode so the output appears clearly line by line.
02:47
Add a delay of one second so the readings can be observed smoothly. 
02:52
Upload the code and open the serial monitor. 
02:55
You will now see the real time values detected by the BMP 388 sensor.
03:03
The pressure, altitude and temperature readings will continuously update based on environmental changes when pressured.
<--------------code-box video 24 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
PIR motion sensor. 
00:07
The PIR motion sensor uses the RE-200 BP sensing element. 
00:12
It works based on the pyroelectric effect, which means it can detect infrared radiation naturally released.
00:20
By a human body or an animal, with the help of a Fresnel lens, the sensor can detect motion from a greater distance and over a wider area. 
00:30
When a person or an animal moves within its sensing range, the PIR sensor outputs a high signal. 
00:37
When no motion is present, it outputs a low signal.
00:41
The programming blocks shown demonstrate how to read the PIR sensor value and use it inside an IF and else structure. 
00:49
The code checks whether motion is detected. 
00:51
If the condition is true, the instructions inside the IF section will run. 
00:56
If the condition is false, the code inside the L section will run.
01:02
To test the PIR sensor code, you can either load the prepared file directly from your computer or manually build the blocks yourself. 
01:10
After opening the software, you choose the option to load from your computer. 
01:15
Once the file is opened, the code appears in the workspace when building the blocks manually.
01:22
To start with the block that runs when Arduino begins. 
01:25
You then add the serial block and set the board rate as needed. 
01:30
Inside a forever loop you insert an if and else block. 
01:34
The goal is to continuously check the PIR sensor reading. 
01:38
From the PIR category you select the block that reads.
01:42
The PIR motion sensor value from the chosen interface pin. 
01:46
This block is then placed inside the condition area of the IF structure. 
01:51
If motion is detected, you can program the system to send a message through the serial monitor, such as printing the words someone. 
01:59
If no motion is detected the code.
02:02
Inside the else portion will run instead printing the message no one. 
02:06
Now let us understand how to complete the test code for the PIR motion sensor. 
02:12
After adding the print some one block under the if section, we also need to add the print no one block under the L section. 
02:21
This ensures that the system responds correctly.
02:24
Based on whether motion is detected or not, once both blocks are placed in the correct positions, the program becomes complete. 
02:32
The forever loop continuously checks for movement. 
02:35
If motion is detected by the PIR sensor, the system prints the word someone in the serial monitor.
02:44
If no movement is detected, the system prints the message No one. 
02:48
This completed code allows us to clearly observe how the PIR sensor responds in real time. 
02:54
When we upload the code to Arduino and open the serial monitor, we can see the live output as a person moves in front of the.
03:04
Sensor the serial monitor prints someone. 
03:06
When no motion is detected, the serial monitor prints no one. 
03:11
This helps verify that the sensor and the code are working correctly.
<------------------------------Code-box video 25 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Photo resistor is a photoelectric device that operates according to the principle of semiconductor photoconductivity. 
00:12
It can sense the brightness of the surrounding environment and convert it into an analog value that.
00:20
Changes based on light intensity. 
00:22
In this activity, we will learn how to read the analog value of the photoresistor using Kids Block. 
00:29
First, open the code file by clicking the file button and selecting Load from your computer or open the downloaded code from your desktop. 
00:38
You can also build the program.
00:40
Manually begin by dragging the when Arduino begin block. 
00:44
Then go to the serial category and choose the begin board rate block and set it to 9600 and place it under the begin block. 
00:53
Next go to control and drag the forever block. 
00:57
Then return to cereal and drag the print block.
01:00
And place it inside the forever loop. 
01:03
Now go to the light category and select the read the value of light block and insert it into the print block so that the sensor value will be displayed. 
01:13
Add a wait half second block below it to clearly observe changes. 
01:18
Upload the code to the board after uploading.
01:21
Open the serial monitor. 
01:22
You will now see the analog values of the photoresistor changing continuously. 
01:27
When you cover the sensor with your hand, the value drops. 
01:31
When you shine more light, the value rises. 
01:35
This confirms that the photo resistor is working correctly and can detect real time changes in brightness.
<-------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello so today we will learn how project 21 sound controlled LED works by explaining the code block step by step followed by wiring and output. 
00:16
First take the when Arduino begin block.
00:20
This block runs only once when the board is powered on. 
00:24
Inside this block, take the Set Pin IO 25 mode output block. 
00:29
This tells the Arduino that the LED connected to pin IO25 will be used as an output device. 
00:36
Next, take the forever block. 
00:38
This block keeps the program running continuously.
00:42
Inside the forever block, take the IF else block. 
00:45
In the condition section, place the block read the value of sound IO 33 greater than 100. 
00:51
This block checks whether the sound sensor is detecting a loud sound greater than the set threshold value. 
00:57
Inside the if part, take the LED pin IO 25 out high block.
01:03
This turns the LED on when a loud sound is detected. 
01:07
After that at a wait 2 seconds block. 
01:10
So the LED stays on for a short time. 
01:13
Inside the else part, take the LED pin IO 25 out low block. 
01:17
This turns the LED off when the sound level is low. 
01:21
Now let's understand the wiring.
01:24
Connect the sound sensor signal pin to IO33 on the board and connect its VCC and GND properly. 
01:30
Connect the LED to pin IO25 and G&D so it can be controlled by the Arduino. 
01:36
Finally, the output. 
01:38
When the board is powered, the LED stays off in silence when you clap or make a loud sound.
01:45
With the sensor, the sound value crosses the threshold and the LED turns on when the sound stops the LED.
<----------------------------Inventer-kit-video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello everyone, in this video we are going to create project 20 light pillar where a dot matrix display is automatically controlled using a photo resistor and an Arduino ESP 32 board.
00:20
We begin by opening the Wiz Robo application, creating a new project, and selecting the Wiz Inventor Kit as the board. 
00:27
Once the programming interface opens, we move to the coding section and start with the One Arduino Begin block. 
00:34
In this block we initialize the dot matrix displayed by setting the DIN pin to IO23.
00:40
The CLK pin to IO 18 and the CS pin to IO 15. 
00:45
We also declare a global integer variable named light and set its initial value to 0. 
00:50
Next, we use the forever loop to continuously read the surrounding light level. 
00:55
The photoresistor connected to analog pin IO 33 is red and mapped from a range of.
01:01
Zero to 4095 into zero to seven, which represents the height of the light pillar on the dot matrix. 
01:08
Before drawing, the display is cleared by filling it with black. 
01:12
Then vertical red lines are drawn on the matrix using the mapped light value, forming a light pillar whose height changes in real time for the.
01:21
Hiring The photo resistor is connected to power ground and analog pin IO 33, allowing the ESP 32 to detect changes in light intensity. 
01:31
The dot matrix display is connected using the specified BIN, CLK and CSS pins.
01:38
As the light around the photo resistor changes, its resistance varies, causing the displayed light pillar to grow taller in bright conditions and shorter and darker conditions, demonstrating automatic light based control of the display.
<----------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello everyone, in this video we are going to create Project 19 dimming lamp where we control the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer and an Arduino ESP 32 board to begin.
00:20
We open the Wiz Robo application and create a new project, then select the board as the Wise Inventor Kit. 
00:26
Once the board is selected, the programming interface opens and we move to the coding section.
00:32
We start by using the one Arduino begin block, which runs once when the board is powered on. 
00:39
Inside this block we declare a global variable named pot and set its initial value to 0. 
00:45
Next we add a forever loop to continuously read the potentiometer value. 
00:49
Inside this loop, the variable pod is set using the map.
00:53
Block which reads the analog value from pin IO 33 and maps it from a range of 0 to 4095 into 0 to 255. 
01:02
This mapped value is then used in the analog write block to control the brightness of an LED connected to pin IO25, allowing the LED brightness to change smoothly as the potentiometer.
01:13
Was turned for the wiring. 
01:15
The potentiometer has three pins. 
01:17
1 outer pin is connected to three volts, the other outer pin is connected to ground and the middle pin is connected to the analog pin IO 33. 
01:27
The LED is connected with its positive terminal to IO25 and its negative terminal to ground.
01:33
Enabling the ESP 32 to control the LED using a PWM signal. 
01:38
The potentiometer works by changing its resistance, which alters the voltage across it. 
01:44
The ESP 32 reads this voltage as a value between 0 and 4095, then converts it into a value between 0 and 200.
01:53
55 to adjust the LED brightness after completing the wiring and uploading the program to the board, rotating the potentiometer changes the LED brightness smoothly from dim to bright, confirming that the dimming lamp project is working successfully.

Hello in this video we are going to create a project named Beating heart which is project 18 and in this project we will display a beating heart animation using an Arduino board and an 8 by 8 matrix display. 
00:19
Let us start.
00:20
By opening the Wiz Robo application. 
00:22
Now create a new project and select the board as was Inventor Kit. 
00:27
After selecting the board, the programming interface opens and we move to the coding section. 
00:32
First we use the block when Arduino begin which runs once when the board is powered on inside this block.
00:40
We initialized the matrix displayed by setting the DIN pin to IO23, CLK pin to IO 18, and CS pin to IO15, and then we set the brightness level so the display is clearly visible. 
00:53
Next we move to the forever loop, which runs continuously. 
00:57
Inside this loop we first clear the matrix.
01:00
Display by filling it with black color. 
01:03
After that we draw a heart shape using multiple draw line blocks with red color. 
01:08
Then we use the refresh display block so the heart appears on the dot matrix. 
01:13
We add a weight of one second to control the beating speed. 
01:17
After the delay, we again clear the display and draw a slightly larger.
01:21
Art pattern using draw line blocks creating the beating effect. 
01:25
Once again we refresh the display and add a one second delay. 
01:29
These steps repeat continuously making the heart look like it is beating. 
01:34
Now let us move to the wiring diagram. 
01:37
The dot matrix display is connected to the board using DIN.
01:41
CLK and CS pins along with power and ground. 
01:45
After completing the wiring, we upload the program to the board. 
01:49
Once uploaded, the dot matrix shows a red beating heart, confirming that the project is working successfully. 
01:56
Thank you for watching.
<------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello in this video we are going to create a project named Invasion alarm which is project 17 and this project helps us detect unwanted movement in a particular area and alert the user instantly. 
00:17
Let us start by opening the Wiz Robo application.
00:21
On the screen now we click on Create New Project and select the board. 
00:26
Here we choose the board as was Inventor Kit. 
00:30
After selecting the board, the programming interface opens.
00:34
Now we move to the coding section. 
00:36
First we drag the block when Arduino begin, which runs once when the board is powered on. 
00:42
Inside this block we add the serial begin block and set the baud rate to 9600 so that the Arduino can communicate with the serial monitor properly. 
00:52
This step is important for viewing.
00:54
Output messages during testing. 
00:55
Next we add the forever loop which keeps running continuously. 
00:59
Inside the forever loop, we place an if else condition to check the PIR motion sensor. 
01:06
Here we use the read interface block, select IO5 as the pin and choose PIR motion sensor as the input device.
01:15
Now if motion is detected, the condition becomes true and the Arduino prints the message someone invaded on the serial monitor and also activates the LED and buzzer to give visual and sound alerts. 
01:27
If motion is not detected, the condition becomes false and the Arduino prints no one on the serial monitor indicating the area is safe.
01:36
We also add a weight of one second to keep the output stable and readable. 
01:41
Now let us move to the wiring diagram. 
01:43
The air sensor VCC is connected to five volts, G&D to ground and the out pin to IO5. 
01:49
The LED is connected with a resistor to a digital output pin and ground, and the buzzer is connected to another digital.
01:57
Output pin and ground. 
01:58
After completing the wiring we upload the program. 
02:01
Now we open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. 
02:06
When there is no movement it shows no one and when motion is detected it shows someone invaded confirming the invasion. 
02:14
Alarm system is working successfully.
<------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 6 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello so today we will learn how project 16 time bomb works by understanding the code, wiring and output. 
00:13
In the code when the Arduino starts all button pins are set as input and the buzzer pin is set as output.
00:21
The dot matrix display is initialized using the DIN and CLK pins. 
00:26
Its brightness is adjusted, and a global variable is declared to store the countdown time inside the loop. 
00:33
The matrix display is continuously cleared and refreshed.
00:37
Pressing the increase button raises the timer value while the decrease button lowers it and the updated value is shown on the TM1650 digital tube display. 
00:46
When the start button is pressed, the countdown begins and the value decreases step by step. 
00:52
During this process, the dot matrix shows ball related symbols and the buzzer.
00:56
Turns on and off with delays to give warning beeps.
01:00
If the timer reaches 0, the buzzer sounds an alarm and the matrix displays an explosion style image.
01:06
A reset button allows the system to stop the alarm and return the timer to 0, and the code also ensures the value does not exceed its limit for wiring. 
01:16
All buttons are connected to their respective interface pins on the board with common power and ground. 
01:22
The dot matrix display is connected using its DIN and CLK pins along with VCC.
01:27
G and the TM1650 digital tube display is connected through its data and clock lines to show the countdown clearly. 
01:34
The buzzer is connected to a digital output pin and ground so it can be controlled directly by the program as the output. 
01:42
When the board is powered, the digital tube shows the set time.
01:47
Ressing the buttons increases or decreases the value. 
01:50
Once the countdown starts, the numbers reduce smoothly. 
01:54
The dot matrix displays animated bomb expressions and the.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor KITIN this project we are working with a programmable responder system. 
00:12
This system is used in quiz competitions and classrooms where students press buttons to answer questions. 
00:17
The system checks the responses using LED's.
00:20
And helps improve students reaction time and attention. 
00:23
Now let us understand how the program works. 
00:26
We are simply understanding the logic behind the program. 
00:29
First, several pins are configured. 
00:30
The following pins are set as input.
00:34
IO16IO17IO18IO19 These pins are connected to the buttons. 
00:38
The following pins are set as output. 
00:41
IO12IO13IO14 IO 27. 
00:43
These pins are connected to the LED's that indicate the response result. 
00:48
Then a global variable named item is created and initialized with the value 0.
00:55
This variable is used as a control flag for the system. 
00:59
Now the program enters the forever loop, which keeps running continuously. 
01:03
First, the LED on IO27 is turned on. 
01:06
This LED indicates that the system is ready to receive responses.
01:12
Now the program checks if the button connected to ion 19 is pressed. 
01:17
The system starts the response round. 
01:20
Once the round starts, all LEDs IO12IO13IO14 IO 27 are turned off. 
01:24
To clear any previous result dot. 
01:27
A short delay of 0.2 seconds is given.
01:31
Now the program enters a loop that continues until item becomes one dot. 
01:35
This means the system will keep waiting until a valid response is received. 
01:39
Inside this waiting loop, the program monitors three buttons.
01:43
If the button on IO18IS pressed, the LED on IO12 turns on and item is set to 1 dot. 
01:49
If the button on IO17 is pressed, the LED on IO13 turns on, an item is set to 1 dot. 
01:54
If the button on iOS 16 is pressed, the LED on IO14 turns on and item is set to 1 dot. 
02:01
After uploading the code as soon as any one of these.
02:04
Buttons as pressed, the value of item becomes one and the system stops checking further buttons. 
02:09
This ensures that only the first response is accepted, just like in a real quiz competition.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:07
This is the extended version of the Mini Lamp project. 
00:10
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:13
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port. 
00:18
Once the kit is connected we can start.
00:20
Loading this project, we will control a lamp using a button. 
00:24
When the button is pressed, the lamp will turn on. 
00:27
When the button is released, the lamp will turn off. 
00:30
Now let us build the program step by step. 
00:33
First go to the event section and drag when Arduino began. 
00:36
Next go to the pin section and set IO4AS output for the lamp.
00:40
LED IO15 as input for the button. 
00:43
Now go to the control section and add the forever block. 
00:46
Inside the forever block add an if else statement for the condition choose interface IO15 button will be pushed.
00:53
If this condition is true, it means the button is pressed besso inside the if part addled pin IO4 out hi GH. 
01:00
This turns the lamp on to I and the else part addled pin IO4 out LW. 
01:05
This turns the lamp off when the button is not pressed. 
01:08
Now upload the program to the Wiz inventor kit. 
01:11
After uploading press the button, the lamp turns on.
01:14
Release the button, the lamp turns off. 
01:16
So in this extended version of the Mini Lamp project, we learned how to use conditional logic to control a device using a button. 
01:22
Thank you for watching.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:08
This is project 14 counter. 
00:10
In this project we have already written the program and now we are simply going to understand how the code works this counter.
00:20
And count from zero to 9999 using three buttons. 
00:23
1 button is used to increase the number, one is used to decrease the number and one is used to reset the counter. 
00:32
The value is shown on a 4 digit digital display. 
00:36
Let us understand the logic of the program.
00:40
First 3 pins are configured as input IO17IO18 and IO19. 
00:45
These are connected to the three buttons. 
00:48
Then a global variable named item is created. 
00:51
This variable stores the current number that we see on the display. 
00:57
Now the program enters the forever loop.
01:00
Which keeps running continuously. 
01:02
Inside this loop, the program checks each button. 
01:05
If the button on IO19 is pressed, the value of item increases by one. 
01:11
If the button on IO18IS pressed, the value of item decreases by 1.
01:17
If the button on IO17 is pressed, the value of item is reset to 0. 
01:23
After this the program checks one important condition. 
01:26
If the value becomes greater than 9999, it is automatically set back to 0. 
01:32
This keeps the number within the range of the four digit display finally.
01:37
The updated value of item is sent to the display using the TM1650 display block and a small delay of 0.2 seconds is added so that the counting remains smooth and readable.
01:51
So the program continuously listens to the buttons, updates the number and refreshes the display. 
01:56
This is how the counter works.
01:59
Now upload the program to the Wise Inventor Kit.
02:03
After uploading, press IO19 button, the number increases, ress IO18 button, the number decreases, press IO17 button, the counter resets. 
02:11
The display always stays between 0 and 9999. 
02:14
So in this project we learned how to create a multifunction digital counter using buttons, variables and display control.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:07
This is Project 13 Mini lamp. 
00:09
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:12
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port. 
00:17
Once the kit is connected we can start coding.
00:20
I end this project. 
00:21
We will control a lamp using a button and observe the button status using the serial monitor. 
00:27
Now let us understand the working principle. 
00:29
When the button is not pressed, voltage from VCC passes through a resistor and provides a high signal to the input pin. 
00:36
When the button is pressed, the pin is connected to G&D producing.
00:40
Low signal the resistor prevents a short circuit between VCC and GND. 
00:44
Now let us build the program. 
00:46
First go to the events section and drag when Arduino begin. 
00:50
Then go to the serial section and add serial zero. 
00:53
Begin baudrate 9600. 
00:54
Next go to the pin section and add set pin IO15 mode input. 
00:58
Now go to the control section.
01:00
And add the forever block. 
01:02
Inside the forever loop go to the serial section and drag serial zero print key status in no wrap mode. 
01:08
Then add another serial block and choose Print the state value of button in interface IO15 in wrap mode. 
01:14
Now upload the program to the Wiz Inventor kit. 
01:17
After uploading open the serial monitor and set the baud rate.
01:21
The 96-O dot when you press the button, the serial monitor will display key status 0. 
01:26
When you release the button, it will display key status once. 
01:29
So in this project we learned how to read a button input, understand its logic level.
01:35
And display the result using serial communication. 
01:38
Thank you for watching.

Once the kit is connected, we can start coding. 
00:25
In this project we will create an O distress signal device. 
00:30
An SOS device is used in emergency situations to send a help signal.
00:36
This signal follows Morse code where the letter S is represented by three short blinks and the letter O is represented by three long blinks. 
00:44
Now let us build the program step by step. 
00:47
First go to the events section and drag the block when Arduino begin. 
00:52
Next go to the pin section and drag set pin IO5 mode.
00:56
Output. 
00:56
This prepares the LED connected to IO5 to work as an output. 
01:01
Now go to the control section and add a forever block. 
01:06
This allows the SOS signal to repeat continuously.
01:10
Inside the forever loop, we create the signal, drag a repeat three times block inside it, place LED pin IO5 out high, then add weight 0.15 seconds, then LED pin IO5 out low, then weight 0.1 seconds. 
01:27
This creates 3 quick blinks which represent.

This is Project 2 Breathing LED. 
00:10
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:13
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port once the kit is connected.
00:20
We can start coding. 
00:21
In this project, we will create a breathing LED effect. 
00:25
A breathing LED is an LED whose brightness slowly increases and decreases just like breathing. 
00:30
This effect is created using PWM. 
00:33
Now let us understand what PWM is.
00:37
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. 
00:39
PWM allows us to control analog output using digital signals. 
00:42
To be why changing how long the signal stays high and low, we control the brightness of the LED. 
00:48
More time at high makes the LED brighter, More time at low makes the LED dimmer. 
00:53
This is how we create smooth brightness control. 
00:55
Now let us start.
00:57
Building the program first go to the events section and drag when Arduino begin.
01:02
Next, go to the control section and drag the forever block so the effect runs continuously. 
01:08
Now go to the variable section and create a variable named item with initial value 0 dot. 
01:13
Place this variable inside the forever block. 
01:15
Now go to the control section and drag a repeat block. 
01:19
Set it to 255 times which is the maximum value.
01:22
Or PWM. 
01:23
Inside this repeat block go to variables and drag change item by plus plus.
01:29
This increases the brightness step by step from zero to 255.
01:34
Next, go to the LED section and drag the LED analog write block. 
01:39
Set the LED pin to IO5 and put the variable item in the value field. 
01:44
Now go to control and add a weight block of 0.01 seconds.
01:49
This delay makes the brightness change smooth. 
01:53
Now we create the dimming part again. 
01:56
Add another repeat 255 times, block inside it, drag change item by. 
02:02
This decreases the brightness from 255 back to zero. 
02:06
Add the LED analog write IO5 value.
02:09
Item block again, then add another weight block of 0.01 seconds.
02:16
Now upload the program. 
02:18
After uploading, you will see the LED gradually getting brighter and then dimmer. 
02:23
It will keep repeating this smoothly.

01:16
Now go to the pin section and drag the block. 
01:19
Set IO5 pin to output.
01:22
This tells the board that the LED connected to pin IO5 will be used as an output device. 
01:29
Next, go to the LED section and drag the block LED pin IO5 out high. 
01:34
This turns the LED on. 
01:36

The 130 motor is a simple DC motor module that can be directly connected to the Control Board without using an extra driver, making it ideal for small DIY projects. 
00:16
It works on a voltage range of 3.3 to 5 volts.
00:20
And its speed can be smoothly controlled using PWM. 
00:23
By changing the PWM duty cycle, the average voltage applied to the motor changes, which directly controls the rotation speed. 
00:31
The motor has two control pins, INA and INB, and the direction of rotation depends on which pin has the higher PWM.
00:40
Value. 
00:40
If I and B has a higher PWM value than INA, the motor rotates clockwise and if INA has a higher PWM value than inb, it rotates counterclockwise. 
00:51
When both pins are set to 0, the motor stops.
00:56
In this set, the motor is connected to port 9, where Ina is linked to IO 18 and INB to ion 19. 
01:04
In the program, the motor is first initialized and then inside a continuous loop it runs clockwise at full speed, slows down, stops and then repeats the same sequence in the opposite direction.
01:17
This experiment clearly demonstrates how PWM can be used to control both the speed and direction of a DC motor safely and effectively.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This experiment demonstrates the working of a capacitive touch sensor module which allows touch based switching without any mechanical parts. 
00:13
The sensor uses a capacitive area that detects changes in capacitance when a finger touches it.
00:20
Enabling reliable touch detection. 
00:21
After powering on, the sensor needs about 0.5 seconds to stabilize and perform self calibration, which lasts around 4 seconds, so it should not be touched during this. 
00:33
The module operates on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, consumes very low current.
00:40
And outputs a digital signal. 
00:42
Since it is blue housing, it is connected to a digital port of the main board and in this setup it is connected to port 4 corresponding to digital pin IO 27. 
00:52
When the capacitive area is touched, the sensor outputs a high signal and the onboard red LED turns on and when the touch is released.
01:00
The output goes low and the LED turns off. 
01:03
In the program, the pin mode and serial communication are initialized first and inside a continuous loop the digital value of IO27 is read and compared. 
01:13
If the value is equal to 1, the system recognizes that the sensor is being touched and prints. 
01:19
You press the button.
01:20
On the serial monitor and if the value is not equal to 1, it prints you loosen the button. 
01:27
A short delay of 0.1 seconds is added to refresh the reading smoothly and avoid unstable output. 
01:33
After uploading the code and setting the correct bod rate, touching and releasing the sensor will clearly show the corresponding messages on the serial monitor.
01:42
Confirming the correct operation of the capacitive touch sensor.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This project uses the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor to accurately measure environmental temperature and display the result through the serial monitor. 
00:15
The DS18B20 is a compact, high precision sensor with strong.
00:20
Anti interference capability and a wide detection range from -55°C to plus 125°C, making it reliable for many applications. 
00:27
Since it is a digital module with a blue housing, it is connected to a digital port on the Control Board and in this setup it is attached to port 6 which corresponds to digital pin.
00:41
IO23 In the program, the temperature sensor library is first added and the serial port is initialized so that data can be displayed correctly inside a continuous loop. 
00:52
The system reads the temperature value detected by the D18B20 and prints it to the serial monitor without wrapping, ensuring that the numeric value.
01:01
And its unit appear on the same line. 
01:04
After printing the temperature value, the unit degree C is printed with small spacing to improve readability. 
01:11
Once the code is uploaded and the bot raid is set correctly, the serial monitor continuously shows the real time temperature measured by the DS18B20 sensor, clearly demonstrating.
01:21
A digital temperature sensing and serial output worked together in a simple and effective way.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 4 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This project explains the working of the Five Channel AD Button module which is designed to save input ports by allowing 5 different buttons to be read using only one analog pin. 
00:16
The module works on the principle of voltage division, where.
00:20
Pressing each button produces a different output voltage. 
00:23
This voltage is read by the board's built in ADC, which converts the analog signal into a digital value. 
00:30
Since the board uses a 12 bit ADC with a 3.3 Volt reference, the analog input is converted into values ranging from zero to 4095.
00:40
In this set, the module is connected to the analog port 8 which corresponds to IO34. 
00:46
Inside the program, the pin mode is set and the serial port is initialized first.
00:52
Then in a continuous loop, the analog value from IO34IS read and stored in a variable and this value is printed on the serial monitor. 
01:02
Using conditional checks, the program compares the ADC value with predefined ranges to identify which button is pressed. 
01:09
If the value is below 500, it indicates that.
01:12
L button is pressed.
01:14
Values between 501,000 indicate SW-51000 to 2000 indicate SW-42000 to 3000 indicate SW three, 3000 to 4000 indicate SW 2 and 4000 to 5000 indicate SW1A. 
01:30
Short delay is added to refresh the readings.
01:35
Smoothly after uploading the code and setting the baud rate correctly, pressing different buttons displays the corresponding analog values and button names on the serial monitor, clearly demonstrating how multiple buttons can be detected using a single analog input.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
The IR receiver module is used to receive signals from an infrared remote control and convert them into digital data that the Control Board can understand. 
00:14
It works on a voltage range of 3.3 to 5 volts and is designed to receive standard.
00:20
38 kHz infrared signals commonly used in TV's, air conditioners and other remote controlled devices. 
00:26
The transmitter sends modulated infrared light and the receiver detects this light, converts it into electrical signals and decodes the command. 
00:34
Since it is a digital module, it is connected to a digital port on the board.
00:41
In this set, the IR receiver is connected to port one, where the signal pin is linked to IO 13. 
00:48
In the program, the serial monitor is first initialized and the IR receiver pin is set inside a continuous loop. 
00:55
The program checks whether a signal has been received when a button on the remote is pressed.
01:01
The receiver captures the signal and prints the corresponding key value in hexadecimal format on the serial monitor. 
01:08
A short delay is added to avoid repeated readings from a single button press, and the receiver is refreshed so it can receive the next command. 
01:17
This experiment demonstrates how infrared communication can be used to control robots.
01:21
And electronic projects wirelessly.
<--------------------------------Kit-4-Video 6 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello everyone, today we will learn about manual control mode where we control a fan using a capacitive touch sensor and a 130 motor. 
00:15
In this project the fan works in manual mode, meaning we start and stop it.
00:20
They simply touching the sensor. 
00:22
First we connect the board to the computer and upload the program. 
00:26
Then we focus on understanding how the logic works.
00:30
We begin by importing the DC motor library for ESP 32 and setting the touch sensor pin to IO 27.
00:37
Next, we create a variable called press and set its initial value to 0, which helps us track whether the fan is currently off or on.
00:46
Inside the forever loop, the program continuously checks the state of the touch sensor using a digital read. 
00:52
When the sensor is touched and the value at IO27 becomes one, the program checks the value of the press variable.
01:00
If press is 0, it means the fan is currently off, so the motor is activated using the motor analog write block. 
01:07
The fan starts rotating and the press variable is updated to 1.
01:12
When the sensor is touched again and IO27 reads one while press is already won, the program understands that the fan is running, so it stops the motor and resets press back to 0.
01:23
In this way, each touch acts like a toggle switch. 
01:26
One touch turns the fan on and the next touch turns it off. 
01:31
After uploading the code, we can test the project easily. 
01:35
Touching the capacitive module once starts the fan and touching it again stops the fan. 
01:41
This project clearly demonstrates how variables conditions.
01:43
And continuous loops work together to create a simple and effective manual control system using a touch sensor.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 7 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This experiment explains the working of a photo interrupter module, which operates using a builtin light source and a light receiver to detect interruptions in a light path. 
00:15
The module contains an LED as the light emitter and a photosensitive receiver with a signal.
00:21
Amplifier and When an object passes through the groove and blocks the light, the receiver detects no light, causing a change in resistance that is converted into a digital electrical signal. 
00:32
The photo interrupter works on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, draws about 20-4 milliamps of current, and outputs a digital signal, making it suitable for precise.
00:42
Object detection and counting applications. 
00:43
Since it has blue housing, it is connected to a digital port of the main board and in this setup it is connected to port 3 which corresponds to digital pin IO 26. 
00:54
When the light path is blocked, the module outputs a high signal and when the path is clear it outputs a low signal.
01:03
In the program, the pin mode and serial communication are initialized 1st and variables are created to store the current sensor state, the previous state, and a counter value. 
01:13
Inside a continuous loop. 
01:15
The system repeatedly reads the digital value from IO26 with a short delay to stabilize the readings, compares the current state with the last state.
01:24
And detects changes caused by an object entering or leaving the groove. 
01:28
Each time the light is interrupted, meaning the state changes from low to high, the counter is increased by 1 and the updated count is printed on the serial monitor. 
01:38
After processing, the current state is stored as the last state for the next cycle once the code is uploaded.
01:45
In the correct BOD rate is set. 
01:47
Placing and removing an opaque object through the sensor groove will result in the serial monitor displaying the number of times the light has been interrupted, demonstrating accurate detection and counting of passing objects.
<--------------------------------Kit-4-Video 8 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello everyone, today we will learn how to control a fan using an IR remote by building the logic step by step with drag and drop programming blocks.
00:15
In this project we use events, variables, IR operators, motor and control blocks to read signals from the remote and control the fan speed. 
00:26
We begin by importing the DC motor and IR remote libraries, then initialize 4 variables. 
00:33
Key one_press_number key 2_press_number key three_press_number and, key with initial values of 0 where the first 3 variables store how many times keys 1-2 and three are pressed and the last variable stores the value received from the IR receiver while ina AND inb. 
00:51
Are set to 0 and the IR receiver pin is INITIALIZED as IO13Inside the forever loop, the program continuously checks whether an infrared signal is received. 
01:01
When a signal arrives, the received value is stored in the key variable and the IR receiver is refreshed.
01:09
If key one is detected, key one_press_number increases by 1 and the other two key variables are reset to 0. 
01:16
The fan at high speed, key 2 at medium speed, key three at low speed, and pressing the same key again stops the fan, clearly demonstrating how variables, conditions, loops and IR control work together.
01:29
In a practical project.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 9 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This experiment introduces the RGB LED module with a common anode, which combines three LED's, red, green and blue into a single unit to produce a wide range of colors, including white by mixing these primary colors.
00:20
In different proportions based on trichromatic theory. 
00:23
Unlike a white LED that emits white light directly, an RGB LED generates colors through additive color mixing, where equal intensities of red, green, and blue light produce white. 
00:35
The module operates on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, consumes about 19.5.
00:42
Milliamperes of current and is designed to work within a temperature range of -10 to plus 50°C. 
00:48
It has four pins, 3 control pins for red, green and blue, and one common anode pin that connects to the positive power supply. 
00:57
In this setup the RGB LED module is connected to a white port.
01:02
On the main board, specifically port one where the red pen connects to IO12, the green pin to IO13, and the blue pen to IO 14. 
01:12
Each color is controlled digitally, so setting a pin high turns the corresponding color on, while setting it low turns it off. 
01:19
After initializing the pins as outputs the main program.
01:23
Runs in a continuous loop where the LED lights up red, then green, then blue, and finally white, with each color displayed for one second. 
01:32
Once the code is uploaded successfully, the visible result is an RGB LED smoothly cycling through red, green, blue, and white colors in a repeating sequence.
<-------------------------------Kit-4-Video 10 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This temperature detection system automatically controls a fan based on the surrounding temperature. 
00:12
It uses a D18B20 temperature sensor to continuously monitor the temperature and A130DC motor to drive the fan.
00:20
The temperature sensor reads the current temperature and sends the value to the Control Board, where it is also displayed on the serial monitor. 
00:30
In the program, a temperature threshold of 30°C is set, which can be adjusted as needed. 
00:36
When the detected temperature rises above 30°C, the Control Board activates the motor using PWM.
00:42
Causing the fan to rotate and cool the system.
00:45
When the temperature drops to 30°C or below, the motor stops and the fan turns off automatically.
00:52
This setup demonstrates how sensors and motors can work together to create an automatic cooling system similar to those used in electronic devices and smart machines.
01:07
I don't know.
01:15
I can deal with you.
<------------------------------Kit-4-Video 11 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This project introduces the TM 1654 digit tube display module which uses a 0.36 inch red common cathode digital display driven by the TM1650 chip. 
00:16
The key advantage of this module is that it only requires.
00:21
2 signal wires to communicate with the main board using A2 wire serial protocol, which is similar to but not exactly the same as standard I2C, helping to save IO pins. 
00:32
The module operates at 3.3 to 5 volts and is connected to the green ports on the board after importing the TM1650 display library.
00:41
In the program, the display is first initialized, cleared and then turned on and an integer variable I is defined with an initial value of 0. 
00:50
Inside a continuous loop, the program checks whether the value of I is less than 999. 
00:55
If it is, the value of I is converted into a string and displayed on the 4 digit tube.
01:02
Then I is increased by one. 
01:04
If I reaches 999, it is reset back to zero so the counting can start again. 
01:10
A short delay of 0.01 seconds is added to control the refresh speed of the display. 
01:17
After uploading the code, the digital tube continuously counts from zero to 999.
01:22
And then repeats, clearly demonstrating how numbers can be displayed and refreshed smoothly using the TM 1654 digit tube module.
<------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 12 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
00:06
This trigger mode system allows the fan to turn on automatically when an object comes close to it. 
00:12
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of nearby objects and A130DC motor to drive the fan.
00:20
The ultrasonic sensor continuously sends out sound waves and calculates the distance based on the reflected signal, while the measured distance is displayed on the serial monitor. 
00:30
In the program, a distance threshold of 10 centimeters is set, which can be changed according to requirements when the detected distance becomes less than 10 centimeters.
00:40
The Control Board activates the motor using PWM, causing the fan to rotate. 
00:45
When the distance is equal to or greater than 10 centimeters, the motor stops and the fan turns off. 
00:52
This experiment demonstrates how distance sensing can be used to trigger automatic actions similar to touchless fans and smart safety systems.
01:01
It also helps learners understand sensor integration, real time decision making, and motor control and automation projects.
<------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 13 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This project demonstrates how an ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between the sensor and an object by mimicking the natural echolocation ability of bats. 
00:15
The sensor works by sending out ultrasonic sound waves at a frequency of 40 kHz.
00:22
When these waves hit an obstacle, they are reflected back to the sensor. 
00:26
By measuring the time taken for the sound waves to travel to the object and return, the system calculates the distance accurately. 
00:34
In this setup, the ultrasonic sensor operates at 5 volts and can measure distances ranging from 2cm up to 400 centimeters.
00:43
Since the ultrasonic module cannot be connected directly to the board, a converter module is used and the sensor is connected to port 7 where the trigger pin is linked to IO16 and the echo pin to IO35. 
00:56
In the program, the ultrasonic library is added and the serial port is initialized first.
01:02
Inside a continuous loop, the system reads the distance detected by the sensor and prints the value on the serial monitor. 
01:10
A short delay is added to refresh the reading smoothly. 
01:14
After uploading the code, the serial monitor continuously displays the real time distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the nearby obstacle, clearly showing.
01:23
While ultrasonic ranging works in practical applications.
<-------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 14 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello everyone, in this project we are going to explore variable speed mode where we control the rotation speed of a small fan using a 5 channel AD button module and A130 motor after connecting the board.
00:20
And uploading the program. 
00:21
The system works by first initializing the required pin modes and starting the serial port for monitoring values. 
00:28
Inside the main loop, the program continuously reads the analog values from the AD button module to detect which button is pressed. 
00:36
Each button corresponds to a different speed level when button 5.
00:40
Pressed the fan speed is set to 40%, button four sets it to 60%, button three sets it to 80% and button 2 sets it to 100%, while button one stops the fan completely. 
00:52
To achieve accurate speed control, the program uses a map function which converts the speed range of zero to 100 into the PWM.
01:01
Range of 0 to 255. 
01:03
Since motor speed depends on the PWM duty cycle, this means each speed unit is mapped proportionally to a PWM value, allowing smooth and precise control without manual calculations. 
01:14
The mapped PWM value is then sent to the motor using the motor analog write block.
01:21
Making the fan rotate at the selected speed. 
01:24
By duplicating the same logic for different speed values, we can easily create multiple speed levels. 
01:30
After uploading the code. 
01:31
Pressing buttons from 5:00 to 2:00 increases the fan speed step by step from 40% to 100%, and pressing button one turns the fan off, clearly demonstrating.
01:42
While analog input mapping and PWM work together to implement an effective variable speed control system.
<-------------------------------Inventer-kit-video 15 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This experiment explains how the white LED module works and how it is controlled using the Easy Plug Control Board. 
00:13
An LED, or light emitting diode converts electrical energy into light and is commonly used as an indicator or display.
00:20
Element with different materials producing different colors such as red, green, yellow, and blue. 
00:25
The white LED module operates on 3.3 to 5 volts using a digital control signal and connects to a telephone socket interface. 
00:34
Since modules with blue housing are digital, the white LED is connected to a digital port.
00:41
And in this setup it is connected to port one, which corresponds to digital pin IO 13. 
00:46
The pin mode of IO 13 is set to output so the main board can send high or low signals to the LED's inside a continuous loop. 
00:54
The pin is set HIGH to turn the LED on, followed by a one second delay, then set LOW to turn the LED.
01:01
Off followed by another one second delay. 
01:03
This sequence repeats continuously, causing the LED to blink with a one second interval, and after uploading the code successfully, the result is a white LED that turns ON for one second and OFF for one second repeatedly.

An LDR or light dependent resistor helps Arduino detect the amount of light present in the surroundings.
00:23
This concept is used in real life in automatic St. 
00:27
lights, smart lamps, mobile phone brightness control and smart home lighting systems where devices respond automatically based on light intensity.
00:36
In the coding part, Arduino reads the analog value from the LDR sensor.
00:41
Using a simple if else condition, Arduino compares the light value with a fixed threshold and decides the output action.
00:48
For wiring connections, the LDR is connected in a voltage divider circuit and attached to an analog pin of Arduino.
00:56
An output device like an LED or relay is connected to a digital pin to indicate the detected light condition.
01:03
During testing, when light falls on the LDR, the sensor value increases.
01:09
When the LDR is covered to simulate darkness, the value decreases, confirming that the light detection system is working correctly.

Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo. 
00:08
In today's project we are going to learn how to interface a push button with a nice superscript 2C LCD display using Arduino. 
00:16
This is a very basic yet important project that.
00:20
Helps us understand input and output devices and embedded systems.
00:24
This concept is widely used in real life, For example in elevators, when you press a button, the selected floor number appears on a display.
00:34
Similarly, in digital attendance systems or ticket machines, pressing a button triggers a message on the screen. 
00:41
To build this project, we use an Arduino Uno, a push button, and a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD display. 
00:49
The I Superscript 2C LCD reduces wiring complexity by using only two data lines.
00:55
SDA and SCL along with power and ground. 
00:58
Before uploading the code we need to install the required library.
01:03
In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch, then Include Library, then Manage Libraries. 
01:08
Search for Liquid Crystal I2C and install it. 
01:12
In the program, we first include the wire library for our Superscript 2C communication and the Liquid Crystal I2C library to control the LCD. 
01:21
We then define the button pin.
01:23
As digital pin 3 and create an LCD object with address 0X27 and size 16 by two. 
01:30
In the setup function we configure the button as input pull, which means we do not need an external resistor.
01:38
Then we initialize the I Superscript 2C communication, start the LCD and turn on its backlight. 
01:44
In the loop function, we continuously read the button state. 
01:48
When the button is pressed, the Arduino detects a low signal, moves the cursor to the first row of the LCD and displays the message Hello when the button is released.
01:59
The screen is cleared for wiring. 
02:01
1 terminal of the button is connected to digital pin 3 and the other to ground.
02:07
The LCD's VCC connects to 5V, G&D to ground, SDA to a four and SCL to A5. 
02:14
After uploading the code, when you press the button, the word Hello appears on the LCD. 
02:20
When you release it, the display clears.
02:32
Congratulations, you have successfully completed the button and LCD project.

This project is an RGB LED color control system using Arduino. 
00:10
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how different colors can be produced using a single RGB LED by controlling its three primary color components.
00:20
Red, Green and Blue. 
00:22
The RGB LED has three internal LEDs, Red, Green and Blue, which are connected to the Arduino through current limiting resistors.
00:32
By turning these LED's on and off in different combinations, we can generate multiple colors such as red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, and white. 
00:43

In this project we have designed an LCD based sensor display system using Arduino and a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD. 
00:14
The main objective of this project is to monitor environmental parameters and display them in real time.
00:20
In an LCD screen, the system uses a DHT 11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and an LDR sensor to detect light intensity in the surrounding environment. 
00:31
These sensor values are continuously read by the Arduino Uno and processed internally.
00:37
Instead of using many wires, this project uses I Superscript 2C communication, which allows the LCD to work using only two data lines, SDA and SCL. 
00:49
This makes the circuit simple, compact and more reliable, especially for IoT and embedded system applications. 
00:56
The measured temperature.
00:57
Humidity and light intensity values are displayed on the 16 by 2 LCD in an easy to understand format, allowing users to monitor environmental conditions without the need for a serial monitor or computer connection.
01:12
This type of project is widely used in smart homes, whether monitoring systems, classrooms, greenhouses and industrial automation panels. 
01:20
It is an excellent project for students and beginners to understand sensor interfacing I Superscript 2C communication and real time data display using Arduino.

Hello my dear friends, today I am presenting my project called Automatic Light Control System. 
00:11
The aim of this project is to automatically turn a light on or off based on surrounding light conditions to save electricity.
00:20
In this project, an LDR sensor detects the light intensity and sends its value to the microcontroller. 
00:27
When the surroundings become dark, the LDR value decreases and the microcontroller activates the relay, which works as an electrically operated switch and turns the light on.
00:38
When sufficient light is present, the relay turns off and the light switches off automatically. 
00:44
The relay is connected using calm and and no terminals along with the resistor for safety. 
00:49
This project is very useful for street lights, home automation and energy saving applications.
00:55
Thank you.
<-------------------------------Iot-kit-video 18 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we are implementing a temperature based LED control project using Arduino Uno, DHT 11 sensor and a relay module where an LED turns on automatically when the temperature rises above a set limit.
00:20
Arduino Uno acts as the controller, DHT 11 works as the temperature sensor and the relay acts as an electrically operated switch. 
00:28
The DHT 11 sensor is connected with its VCC to 5V, data pin to digital pin, D7 and G&D to ground.
00:38
The relay module is connected with in one to D8BCC to 5V and G&D to G&D, and since the relay is a low level trigger module, it turns on when the lowest signal is applied. 
00:50
The LED is connected through the normally open terminal of the relay, with its positive connected to 5V through a resistor and its negative connected to the.
00:59
Now terminal while Cam is connected to ground.
01:03
In the code, the DHT library is used to read the temperature value and Arduino continuously checks if the temperature exceeds 30°C. 
01:11
If it does, Arduino sends a low signal to the relay pin, turning on the relay and lighting the LED's and if the temperature.
<-----------------------------------Iot-kit-video 19 ------------------------------------------------------------------->Good morning my dear friends. 
00:08
Today I am very happy to present my project titled Relay Controlled LED System using a Microcontroller. 
00:13
The main objective of this project is to understand how a relay can be used as an electrically operated.
00:20
Switch to control devices safely and efficiently. 
00:23
In this system, each LED has two terminals known as the anode and a cathode.
00:29
The cathode of each LED is connected directly to ground, while the anode is connected through a 220 ohm current limiting resistor to the calm terminal of the relay. 
00:39
The no or normally open terminal of the relay is connected to a 5 Volt power supply. 
00:44
When the relay is in the off state, the circuit remains open so no current flows.
00:49
And the LED stays off.
00:52
When the microcontroller sends a signal to the relay through the programmed code, the relay turns on and the comment and no terminals get connected, completing the circuit and allowing current to flow through the resistor and LED, causing the LED to light up.
<-----------------------------------Iot-kit-video 20 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we are implementing a button controlled relay project using Arduino Uno and a 2 channel relay module where a push button is used to manually control the relay operation. 
00:17
Arduino Uno acts as the controller the push button.
00:20
Acts as an input device and the relay module is used to switch external electrical devices. 
00:26
The relay module is a 5 Volt optic coupler based low level trigger relay, meaning the relay turns on when the input signal is low.
00:35
For wiring, the push button is connected between digital pin D2 and G&D. 
00:40
Relay in one is connected to D8, in two to D9, while VCC and GND D of the relay are connected to 5V and G&D of Arduino. 
00:49
In the code the button pen is configured as input_pull up so the pin reads high.
00:55
Normally and low, when the button is pressed, both relay pins are set as output and initially kept off by sending high signals.
01:04
Inside the loop function, Arduino continuously reads the button state and when the button is pressed it sends low signals to both relay pins to turn them on, and when the button is released it sends high signals to turn them off. 
01:19
This project helps students understand digital input reading, low level relay control, and basic manual automation concepts.
<-------------------------------Iot-kit-video 21 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we are working on a 2 channel relay on and off control project using Arduino Uno where Arduino Uno acts as the main controller and a fivefold optocoupler based low level trigger relay module is used to control electrical devices.
00:21
The relay module is connected such that in one is connected to digital pin D8, in two is connected to digital pin, D9DC is connected to 5V and G&D is connected to G&D.
00:35
In the Arduino code we 1st declare 2 integer variables to store the relay pin numbers and then inside the setup function we set both pins as output using the pin mode function and keep both relays off initially by sending high signals because this relay works on low level triggering.
00:53
In the loop function, Arduino sends a low signal to pin D8 to turn on relay one while keeping relay 2 off. 
00:59
Then after a delay of two seconds, it turns relay one off and sends a low signal to pin D9 to turn on relay 2, and after another delay it sends high signals to both pins to turn both relays off.
01:13
This process keeps repeating continuously, allowing us to observe the relay switching through LED indicators and clicking sounds. 
01:19
And through this project, students learn how digital output pins work, how low level triggered relays operate, and how Arduino can be used for basic automation and control applications.

In this project we are creating a simple alert system using Arduino, a push button, an RGB LED and a buzzer. 
00:16
This system is useful for emergency alarms, security systems and classroom call buttons where a person can press a button to give an alert. 
00:25
In the code we define the button pin RGB.
00:28
LED pins and buzzer pin and set them as input and output in the setup function. 
00:34
In the loop function, Arduino continuously checks the button state.
00:39
When the button is pressed, the system goes into alert mode, the red color of the RGB LED turns on and the buzzer starts beeping.
00:47
When the button is not pressed, the system stays in safe mode, the green LED turns on, and the buzzer remains off. 
00:54
For wiring, we connect the button to pin 2 and ground, the RGB red pen to pin 9, green pen to pen 10, the common pin to ground, and the buzzer to pin 8 and ground.
01:06

The IR receiver is also initialized on pin 6 and both servos are set to their starting positions, so the crane is in a stable state.
00:30
Inside the forever loop, the Arduino keeps checking if any data is received from the IR remote.
00:36
Whenever a button is pressed, the IR receiver reads the hex value of that button and refreshes for the next command. 
00:43
Each hex value is linked to a specific action. 
00:46
For example, when 1 button is pressed, the OLED shows a symbol and a servo on pin 13 rotates slightly to move the crane left or right.
00:56
Another button makes the servo rotate in the opposite direction.
01:01
When the up button is pressed, the servo on pin 12 moves to raise the object and when the down button is pressed, the servo moves back to lower the object.
01:10
At the same time, the OLED display updates to show arrows or icons so we can visually understand what action the crane is performing. 
01:19
This project helps us learn how IR remote communication works, how different inputs can control motors, and how multiple components like servos and OLED displays can work together to create a smart machine.
<-----------------------------Whiz builder-video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
In this project we create an automatic CSI using a Control Board and a servo motor. 
00:11
A seesaw normally moves up and down when children push with their feet, but here the movement is controlled electronically.
00:19
The servo motor is connected to pin 13 of the main board, with its power and ground properly connected. 
00:25
When the program starts, the board sends angle and delay commands to the servo motor. 
00:30
By changing the angle value, the servo rotates in a specific direction and speed, which makes one side of the seesaw rise while the other side falls.
00:40
An angle close to 90 slows or stops the rotation, while values lower or higher than 90 control the direction and speed. 
00:47
With the added delay, the motion becomes smooth and continuous, giving the seesaw A realistic up and down movement.
00:55
This project helps students understand how servo motors work, how angles control motion, and how simple coding can automate mechanical movements in real life models.
<-----------------------------Whiz builder-video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
This rope skipping machine uses a joystick module, a 360° servo motor, and a passive buzzer to create an automatic skipping system.
00:15
The joystick works using I2C communication and provides 2 analog values X&Y ranging from zero to 1023 along with a digital button output in the neutral position. 
00:28
Both X&Y values are around 512. 
00:31
The 360° servo motor is connected to pin D13.
00:36
And is controlled by changing its angle value. 
00:39
When the servo angle is set to 90°, the motor stops rotating.
00:44
If the angle is less than 90°, the servo rotates in One Direction and if it is greater than 90° it rotates in the opposite direction. 
00:53
By changing how far the value is from 90°, the speed of rotation can be increased or decreased.
01:01
In the program, the joystick values are continuously read inside a loop. 
01:05
If the X axis value is greater than 512, the rope rotates in One Direction. 
01:11
If it is less than 512, the rope rotates in the opposite direction.
01:17
This allows the skipping direction and speed to be controlled smoothly using the joystick.
01:22
When the joystick button is pressed, the passive buzzer plays a sound giving audio feedback to the user. 
01:29
This.
<-----------------------------------code-cartoon-video 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Characters to life by coding your own animations. 
00:08
Make them jump, talk, fly, or anything else you can imagine.
00:14
To start, let's have our character say something. 
00:17
I'll have her say hello friends.
00:20
Click the block to see what it does.
00:23
Let's have this code run when we hit the green flag.
00:30
You can also animate a character by switching costumes. 
00:33
I'll grab the next costume block.
00:39
Let's add a play sound block.
00:45
We can have the code run when we click the Sprite. 
00:49
I'll grab the when Sprite clicked block.
00:53
Let's start to code another character. 
00:55
I'll select JP.
00:57
Once I've clicked on JP, I'll be adding code for JP. 
01:01
Maybe we can make JP grow and shrink. 
01:03
You can make a character get bigger by changing the size.
01:08
And get smaller by typing a -Let's put this change size by 10 block in a repeat loop. 
01:20
This makes the character grow gradually.
01:22
We can put the change size by -10 block in a repeat loop too.
01:28
And I'll add a sound.
01:33
Now let's also have this code run when we click this Sprite.
01:37
Yeah.
01:39
Click the green arrow for more ideas. 
01:41
What will you create?
<-----------------------------code-cartoon-video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
With Scratch you can animate an adventure game. 
00:12
I want Garnet to be my main character. 
00:15
You can pick any one you want and if you can't see your character.
00:20
Click on their icon and you can make them show up or hide by clicking these buttons on and off. 
00:26
Click on the icon of your character and now you can program them to do things in Scratch. 
00:32
You drag out blocks of code from here to make programs here which will make things happen here on the stage. 
00:38
Now let's make our game.
00:40
As you watch, you can pause the video and try each step. 
00:43
First try going to the looks category and dragging out a save block to make your character say something.
00:50
Now I want to make my character follow the mouse so that I can move her around the screen. 
00:56
To do this, go to the motion category, drag out the block that says Glide 1 seconds to random position and choose mouse pointer from the menu. 
01:04
Attach this block under the say block and let's see what happens. 
01:08
Cool. 
01:08
She talked and then went to my mouse pointer.
01:11
But we want our main character to always follow our mouse pointer. 
01:15
To do this, try dragging out a loop from the control category. 
01:18
When you put code in a loop, that code will happen over and over again.
01:25
Awesome, now we can move our character with the mouse pointer. 
01:28
You can put in a smaller number like .3 if you want your character to move faster. 
01:33
Let's attach this loop back under the save block and put a when green flag clicked block on top and now we can start the game by clicking the green flag.
01:43
Now let's make our character collect items. 
01:45
Click on the icon of the item you want and now you can program the item. 
01:50
Make sure you click show to make your item show up. 
01:53
What should we make the item do? 
01:55
I think that when Garnet catches the gem, I want it to play a sound and then go to a new random place to do this.
02:03
Go to the control category and drag out a Wait until block. 
02:07
Go to the sensing category and grab the block that says Touching mouse pointer and choose your main character from the menu. 
02:13
My main character is Garnet, so I'll choose Garnet, but if Finn was your main character, you'd choose Finn.
02:20
And put that block inside the wait until block. 
02:23
Add a start sound block to make it play a sound and then add a go to random position block to make it go to a random place. 
02:31
And let's add a green flag block on top.
02:38
There we go. 
02:39
The gem waits until Garnet touches it, then plays a sound and goes to a new place. 
02:44
But I want it to do this over and over again, so try dragging out another forever loop and putting the code inside.
02:59
Awesome, we've got a game going. 
03:00
Finally, let's add a score. 
03:02
To do this, go to the variables category and create a variable called score or whatever you want to call it.
03:11
Try dragging out a change variable block and choosing score. 
03:14
And if you put this code inside the loop, the score will increase every time your character catches the item. 
03:20
And let's reset the score to 0 when the game is restarted.
03:30
Click the green arrow to see each step and to find out how to add more levels.
<-----------------------------code-cartoon-video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
00:09
You can use Scratch to make a chase game. 
00:12
To start, let's pick a backdrop.
00:17
Now let's pick a Sprite.
00:20
I'll choose the octopus. 
00:22
Let's make it move when I press the arrow keys.
00:27
When I press the right arrow key, we can make it move right?
00:33
And left arrow to move left.
00:43
Let's add a Sprite to chase.
00:47
I'll choose this star. 
00:48
Let's make this bright move around randomly.
01:05
Click the green arrow to see this code and to see what else you might add to your game.
<-----------------------------code-cartoon-video 4 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
You can use Scratch to tell a story, create a conversation, switch scenes, or do whatever else you can imagine to get started. 
00:15
Let's pick a background. 
00:17
I'll go with the Witch House now.
00:20
Let's pick a Sprite. 
00:21
I'll pick the wizard.
00:25
Let's have our character say something. 
00:27
I'll have my character say welcome to magic school.
00:36
I'd like to add another character, so I'll choose another Sprite. 
00:39
This time I'll pick the elf.
00:42
It looks like the elf isn't facing the wizard, so I'll change the way they're looking. 
00:47
Let's go to the costume tab and choose Flip Horizontal. 
00:50
So the costume is now flipped to face the wizard. 
00:52
Let's make a conversation. 
00:53
I'll add a save block to the elf Sprite. 
00:56
I'll make this character say I'm going on a quest.
01:00
Let's click the green flag to see what happens.
01:04
They both speak at the same time, so let's go ahead and add a weight block before the elf speaks.
01:10
I'll make this 2 seconds.
01:16
Let's have the characters change scenes. 
01:19
I'll add another background. 
01:20
This time I'll choose Mountain.
01:25
I'll reselect the ELF Sprite and go back to the coating area.
01:29
Let's have the characters start at the witch house.
01:35
Wait 4 seconds, which is how long the conversation is.
01:40
And then switched to the mountain backdrop.
01:49
Finally, what if we don't want the wizard to be in the mountain scene? 
01:53
Let's go back to the wizard Sprite and add a when backdrop switches to block.
01:59
I'll set it to mountain and make the wizard hide.
02:05
Let's try it out.
02:12
Looks good. 
02:12
Now let's replay the project. 
02:14
The wizard doesn't show up at all. 
02:16
That's because we've hidden it. 
02:17
So what we'll need to do is add a show block at the top of the script so that whenever someone replays the project, the wizard will show first.
02:33
Click the green arrow to see this code again and explore what else you might add to your story.
<-----------------------------code-cartoon-video 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
You can use your webcam to interact with your Scratch projects, PETA, virtual animal pop balloons, or anything else you can imagine. 
00:15
To start, let's add the video sensing extension.
00:20
So as you can see, it turns on our webcam and gives us a new set of blocks to play with. 
00:26
Let's start by making a simple project where we pet the cat. 
00:30
I'll grab the win. 
00:31
Video motion is greater than 10 block. 
00:33
So the way this block works is it's measuring the amount of motion that happens underneath the Sprite and it's measured.
00:40
On a scale of zero to 100, so 0 is no movement and 100th as much movement as we can do, let's go ahead and stick with the default value of 10. 
00:49
So next I'll grab a play sound until done, block and attach it. 
00:53
So let's give it a shot.
00:57
Maybe we'll try a higher value like 95 just to see what happens. 
01:01
OK, so nothing's happening.
01:04
Really, really have to do a lot of motion. 
01:06
So maybe, maybe we go back to 10.
01:09
Cool, I can't wait to see what you do with video sensing.
<------------------------------code-cartoon-video 6 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
You can make a character fly. 
00:07
It could be anyone flying anywhere. 
00:10
Start by choosing a character to fly with.
00:14
Next, let's pick something to fly past. 
00:17
It can be anything. 
00:19
I'll pick buildings.
00:21
To make our character look like it's moving, we can move the scenery behind it.
00:27
Let's use change acts to move the building across the screen.
00:31
Let's try a negative number to make it look like it's going past it.
00:36
Let's make it repeat.
00:40
Perhaps 50 times.
00:44
Let's have our building start all the way to the right. 
00:47
We can use set X.
00:51
0 is going to be in the middle, so let's try a higher number. 
00:55
I'll try 250.
01:00
Let's have it keep going forever.
01:10
We can start this script by pressing the green flag.
01:17
To learn how to make your character move with arrow keys, add a score or fly with a crew, click the green arrow.
<------------------------------Podcast-video 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------->

Hi everyone, welcome back to the podcast club. 
00:03
And as you all remember last time or we had done and that was all about how to create your own creative titles for the podcast using headline creator said to day we're going to be moving on to another website, another mode of the podcast.
00:21
It's called Zen caster.com Zed.
00:28
Dr.com and this is the platform where we will be recording our podcasts in the studio quality like we have recording studios basically then cast as a platform that provides you with high quality of podcasting recording. 
00:45
So you have to come to this website.
00:48
Make your own account and if you haven't signed up, simply click upon tries and caster for free to make your account and then you have to enter your first name, your last name, user name, e-mail and password and then sign up. 
01:05
That's all you have to do and make sure you always.
01:09
Do it under the guidance of your parents so that they know on which websites you're making the accounts and if you already have an account that you will have after signing up, you have to go and click upon login.
01:24
And after you've logged in, that's how your screen would look like. 
01:28
But you won't be able to see any episodes here 'cause these are all like my recordings. 
01:33
But for you, it will be empty if this is that's the first time you're signing in, or the 1st, or if you haven't even made an episode. 
01:42
So for Zen Caster, he basically can create an episode to start a podcast.
01:46
Recording backing upon creating episode, but this will be done a little bit later. 
01:52
For now we are only by understanding the basics. 
01:55
So in this, what a good feature about recording with Zen Caster is that the audio quality comes better even if you are facing network issues still.
02:06
The voice is crystal clear. 
02:08
Like I love that about Zen Caster. 
02:11
When it comes to the video quality in Zen Caster, when you're recording and see, when you record with video as well and you want to post it on YouTube or anywhere else, the video quality is perfect. 
02:24
It's like 1080 pixels now, the normal 720 pixels.
02:27
Then you have that you have like when your zoom or teams but here it has 1080 pixels and that's way better than normal camera quality. 
02:36
That's why people say it's a port. 
02:38
Proper pseudo recording way of podcasting. 
02:40
So if you see your episodes, all of them that you record here will be saved and you will also delete them.
02:47
If you want after you've recorded, but then they won't be permanently deleted. 
02:51
They will only be like archived in a way give me and you know what I mean. 
02:57
They'll just be removed from displaying in the dashboard, but it will be there in your like, you know, Dropbox the card as well or your Google Drive if you want to connect it.
03:08
Then you have like credits, but you don't need to add any post production credits because it's just you doing it. 
03:14
That's just when you have like you know anybody working for the post production and you want to give credence to the person, then you can put that here, but there's no need. 
03:24
Then we have connected to cloud drives. 
03:26
I just talked about that.
03:28
Whatever records that you would record would automatically be sent to Dropbox or Google Drive, and then you can see your account here.
03:38
If you have to check any illness, see what is your user info and I'll still be able to see how much you've been doing or how active you are. 
03:48
And then if you do and you pay for getting more space but like I don't think you would need to pay because it already provides you with 35 GB space.
03:58
And that's too like you know much because it won't take much space for you when you're recording your episodes. 
04:05
And then you have like log out. 
04:07
If you want to log out from here, you can also go ahead and check out these blog Falls Ancaster, where they provide you with lots of, you know, info about.
04:18
Our podcasting is done and then basically what is podcast guest forms, what will how to release them just about like basic guards about using podcasts, I mean Zen Caster then you have like support. 
04:32
So if you are facing some issues, you can always go and go to supportcertaincast.com.
04:39
And you can always go have checked the articles from here and you can also use the chat bot here to write your questions. 
04:47
And if you have any questions, they would reply and 30 minutes to you. 
04:52
So that's our basics of Zen Caster. 
04:55
All I wanted to do was right now to understand what's Ancaster.
05:00
And make sure that you have an account ready in the class itself. 
05:03
You can only use. 
05:04
Go ahead, get the computer and then make an account. 
05:07
And then I'll meet you at the next class. 
05:09
We'll be understanding how to create an episode. 
05:11
Thank you. 
05:12
Have a nice day.
<-------------------------------------------Podcast-video 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hi everyone, welcome to another class of the podcast club. 
00:04
And as you remember, last time we had learned about how to create an anchor account and what are the features is anchor. 
00:13
So after setting up all of the things to day, we'll be learning how you can create.
00:20
Their own podcast title. 
00:22
And for that you have to search for course schedule decom headline Analyzer or if you just search headline analyzer on Google, the first website that you would get in the description would be go schedule.com.
00:40
You have to click upon that and it will open up the website. 
00:45
So you have to create an account as well on this website. 
00:49
So when you type your headline here, as you can see it will ask you to make an account. 
00:56
But before that what exactly is headline analyzer? 
00:58
So here you can create.
01:00
Their own creative headlines and whatever you have thought, you can type it in here and then it will give you the percentage of how much accurate or how much creative, how much are powerful your headline is. 
01:15
So if your headline comes above 50%, it's good to go. 
01:19
But we can always.
01:20
Improve ourselves and I'll be putting in my headline here right now and then we'll see what all the features the headline headline analyzer provides us with. 
01:33
So let me quickly type the podcast name of my podcast. 
01:38
Each one teach 10-and amazing.
01:44
World of STEM and then you have to click upon analyze now and then you have to create an account. 
01:51
So you just have to get the full name, e-mail ID, company name. 
01:56
I don't think this is required but so you can add any company name here or if you have any company website URL.
02:04
So you can put that here and then also add the password.
02:09
After you have entered all the credentials, it will open up the account that you have just made and then it shows the headline score. 
02:18
So it gives me a 57, a headline score out of 100. 
02:22
That is a good score, not that bad, but like it doesn't always mean that you have to get.
02:29
100 and 100 score, it depends upon how how the headline has to work according to you. 
02:36
So it gives me a headline score of 57 out of which it gives me suggestions as well like you. 
02:43
In increase more emotional words you can decrease more common words you can increase the word count partly.
02:50
3 words and then you could rephrase your sentences. 
02:53
So here it shows me that each one each turn and then this means a common word. 
03:00
As you can see a thick this is a powerful word amazing an uncommon is world. 
03:06
Then we have again a common word and strength so.
03:10
First of all I hashtag it, did not realize what exactly it is so that might be a problem. 
03:16
And many of them don't know what stem is, so just took it as a noun here and it has given me more description of how I could decrease the common words. 
03:27
How how much is the limit for the uncommon?
03:30
Words and here it says 0% for emotional. 
03:33
So that means I could add more emotional words here and then I have one power words. 
03:38
If I want I can add more.
03:44
And then here it says that you can add a few more words to grab attention, but I believe that if it is too long it would actually take away the attention. 
03:55
So it should be around like 5 words. 
03:58
5 to 6 words is perfectly alright and mine is about 12345.
04:02
Exciting 6 was good to go. 
04:04
Don't go beyond 6 words because that becomes too lengthy. 
04:08
Then it says 43. 
04:09
Can't pick count um.
04:12
Our 50 to 60 character counts is OK, but not more than that. 
04:17
And then it says what is reading grade level. 
04:20
It gives the sentiment how people would take this as it gives me a positive sentiment and then I'm also able to see if I'm if I have the.
04:32
Ability to scheme this or not. 
04:33
So if I have to skim a path that means cut out a part, it will show me that which part could be skimmed. 
04:40
So it says amazing and world. 
04:42
So actually it is not very necessary that you have to do all of them. 
04:47
But if you want to try it out, you can always do that.
04:52
And that's exactly the headline scored that you would try on your own in the SEO's core. 
04:59
It basically gives you the quality of your arm headline. 
05:04
It gives me an 88% high quality. 
05:07
It shows how many keywords do you have and it will also shows.
05:12
That OHH, would it be visible to the audience when they would search it as a website or what is the score when it comes to 1 to 8? 
05:22
And it gives me a score between 6:00 to 7:00. 
05:25
So that is good. 
05:26
And also you can see that how you could increase your limit here. 
05:30
So that means if it's 54 then.
05:33
That could increase to 5860 and it gives you also more and more inspiration to make your headline better. 
05:40
So that was all about what exactly Headliner is and I wish that you all try this thing because it will help you to make your podcast headlines better.
05:53
And I'm sure by that by now you already have thought what your podcast would be about. 
05:59
So let's get ready and let's get get up and start creating our headlines and our podcast titles and use headliner to make it better. 
06:08
So thank you so much. 
06:10
See you in the next class Bye.
<-------------------------------------------Podcast-video 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------->
(0:00) Hi everyone, today we'll be learning about how to use Anchor and for that we have to (0:08) go ahead search for anchor.fm. So this is a website that's an easiest way to make, (0:15) create, distribute and multihouse your podcast all for free. You don't need to pay at all to get (0:22) started for signing in into this website and it automatically links to lots of other platforms as (0:30) well where people can listen to your podcast. In this video we'll be learning just about the (0:36) basics of anchor and what are the features of anchor.
So first of all if you don't have an (0:42) account on anchor we have to come here to this top right corner and we have this yellow icon of sign (0:49) up. Click upon that and then it asks you for your full name, your email id and password. So these (0:57) are the credentials that you have to fill on your own.
Just for the date of birth you have to make (1:03) sure that it is above the age of 18 that means if you are putting an age of 16 so you won't be able (1:12) to make an account on anchor and it is important that if you are under the age of 18 and you're (1:18) making an account then it should be under the guidance of your parents and they should know (1:23) that you made an account here. They should know the email id and password. So put in your month, day, year (1:29) and it should be that the year that you put in should be like it is telling you above the age of (1:35) 18 and then I'm not a robot sign up.
If you already have an account you can click upon sign in and then (1:43) enter your email id and password. So after you're signed in you'll be able to see your dashboard (1:50) but the only difference it is that if you have signed up for the first time it wouldn't look like (1:56) this. It'll be like you have to complete a few steps of making your podcast name, description, (2:01) create a cover art and many other things.
So for now let me just quickly explain you all the features (2:07) of the anchor website. So the first thing we have here is your podcast description. So this icon (2:16) here means edit.
So under that you can give your podcast a name like I have given (2:22) hashtag each one teach 10 and amazing world of 10. Under that we have a podcast description. (2:29) So this is really important that we're giving a description it should be strong enough (2:33) and it should be catchy enough to attract people and so is for the podcast name.
If it is too long (2:41) or too short it won't attract people to your podcast. But if it is a medium number of letters (2:48) and characters such as a 43 and 507 that's good to go but it should have good quality of information (2:55) as well. Then you have your cover art.
So this can be made through different softwares like Canva, (3:02) Adobe Spark and many other and then you can either download the art and also update it if (3:08) you don't want to change if you don't like it and you want to change this you click upon update (3:13) cover art. Then we have podcast category. So there's lots of categories that we have such as books, (3:21) design, performing arts, we have how to, we have crafts, we have astronomy, we have film history, (3:29) TV reviews and many other.
So I have chosen education because my podcast is about STEM, (3:35) game based learning and many things that can be done in the classroom for better engagement. So (3:41) that's why I've chosen the podcast category of education. Then we have content, clean or explicit.
(3:50) So clean means it is available for everybody or explicit means that only a certain group of age (3:57) can hear to that podcast. Then we have show anchor logo and cover art. So I haven't enabled that (4:05) I just want my people to see only my cover art and not the anchor logo so you can turn that off (4:11) from here.
Then we have show voice messages button on your anchor profile. So this means that if I go (4:19) to the anchor profile I'll be able to see a show voice button there where people can record messages (4:25) to me and send that to me. Just like in YouTube we have the comment section similarly in anchor (4:32) profile we have voice messages.
Then we can also include them in our podcast descriptions. (4:38) So that means if I have used one of the voice messages in my podcast then it automatically (4:44) will be added in the description. Next we have podcast language.
So we can choose from any (4:50) language. I have chosen English. You can choose whatever appeals to you the most.
Then we have (4:55) the account settings. Under that we have the display name that is your name. Then you have (5:01) the email ID your website and then you can also give your anchor custom URL.
So this means that (5:09) if you have google.com slash and then you're searching something so you can see I've got a (5:15) FM slash dashboard that podcast that edit. Similarly I have made my own URL anchor.fm (5:22) slash wonder Namya. It cannot be more than 25 characters.
So make sure that you have it as (5:28) small as possible. Then you can also add your own connections. If you don't have any accounts (5:34) that's OK.
I've added my Twitter account Instagram and YouTube. You can also go ahead add your own (5:40) connections if you want. And yeah that's all about the podcast settings that we have and (5:49) hope you're clear about what exactly a podcast is.
So if you haven't saved the changes then you (5:55) should always click upon save. Otherwise just cancel them if you don't want to save it. So then (6:00) if you scroll down you can also see number of plays you've had in the entire time of your podcast (6:06) and what was the estimated audience based on the recent episodes who are your unique listeners and (6:13) it also shows the current balance.
So for now I believe the current balance only works in Canada (6:20) and United States. But I guess they're trying to come to other countries as well. Next it shows (6:27) the podcast performance.
You can always alter that to daily weekly and monthly. Then we have the top (6:34) episodes. How many views we've got.
And I believe that the first episode always gets the most views. (6:40) That's a fact. Then we have your listeners.
So it shows the exact geographic location. If I go (6:47) under India I can see from Punjab, from Tamil Nadu, from Odisha, Assam and many other. Then we have (6:55) from United States we have Indiana, New Jersey, Georgia, New Hampshire, Illinois and many other.
(7:04) And then all of the countries who have been listening to you. Then the listening platforms (7:08) like we have Anchor, Apple Podcasts, web browser is what I'm using right now, Spotify and other (7:15) are like you know Radio FM and many other. Then the devices.
It shows you like people are (7:24) listening from web, iPhone, Android, Windows and other devices as well. It shows the gender of people (7:30) male, female, not specified, non-binary. And then we also have the ages of people.
And then the source (7:37) is always from Spotify but not for listening platforms because here Spotify itself comes (7:44) in a listening platform. So that's all about the podcast performance and how people are listening (7:51) to you. And then we can always go ahead and see the podcast availability if we come under the (7:59) settings option.
Under that you can see it automatically links to all the platforms. (8:07) So once you've uploaded the first episode on Anchor, it automatically links your podcast (8:13) on Spotify for free. And other platforms are Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Amazon Music, (8:21) Castbox, Pocketcast, Radio Public and Stitcher.
So that's all that you need to know for today on (8:27) what exactly a podcast is and how does the Anchor setup looks like. In the next one we'll be learning (8:34) about how to make your podcast title description and what makes that catchy. So I hope you enjoyed (8:42) the video.
Thank you so much. Have a nice day.
<---------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 1-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Hello students, welcome to another video and here we will be starting with our new project. 
00:05
So I'm thinking of something like a student login application, just where people log in and just get the information they want. 
00:13
So we'll be working on a very simple app, much simpler actually, so let's just make it.
00:20
Login page first. 
00:21
So I have some ideas for the login page, so let's just get started.
00:27
I've imported a few images right here. 
00:29
This is for the background so.
00:33
Let me just adjust it here.
00:45
OK, hope it looks nice. 
00:46
I I should just.
00:52
Increase the size. 
00:53
OK, I think this looks fine now.
00:56
Let's constrain this important.
01:03
And there you go. 
01:04
Now let's import another image.
01:08
Initially I was just looking for a rectangle with rounded edges. 
01:11
I just couldn't find it so.
01:14
And I didn't wanna work hard to find that, so here we are with the regular rectangle anyways, so let's work with this.
01:29
I hope it looks fine. 
01:31
It looks fine, though. 
01:32
Yeah. 
01:32
So now we want some text to be entered. 
01:35
We'll be using this one right here, the third one.
01:40
And.
01:44
Let's give it a hint.
01:49
You're supposed to give it a hint, so it should be enter your username.
01:56
So I want the user to enter their username.
02:00
So it looks something like this, I think pretty OK, sufficiently OK, looks fine and.
02:09
Then we'll let's constrain this as well.
02:13
So we should constraint it here.
02:17
And the other one would go somewhere.
02:24
Here.
02:26
And we will move it a little up.
02:31
Did I mess up? 
02:33
No. 
02:34
OK.
02:37
I think it looks fine here. 
02:40
Now we'll copy this and paste it here itself. 
02:44
We have another one, we'll just adjust it a bit here. 
02:49
Here we will be using Enter.
02:53
Your.
02:55
Password.
02:58
So we have two.
03:01
Fields.
03:05
She just.
03:07
Yeah, and now we need the login button of course, so.
03:19
And the text would be different. 
03:21
Of course we want it to be.
03:24
I don't know what keys I pressed anyway, so.
03:29
OK text.
03:34
There we have it.
03:37
Login.
03:39
And we need to change The Color Purple.
03:44
Button here looks like we don't have any taste, no good taste. 
03:50
So we'll just change that. 
03:52
So changing it to black, for that you will be needing this background. 
03:58
We'll change the background to black.
04:02
I think it should be like 0.
04:05
If you wanted like pure black, the hashes would be this.
04:11
And there we have it. 
04:12
I think I'll just.
04:14
Increase the length.
04:18
OK.
04:21
I think our page looks fine now. 
04:23
You can also add the forgot password and all those things here, but we'll keep it simple for now. 
04:29
So this would be our GUI. 
04:31
We can also remove the borders, though I think I would.
04:40
It must be called outline I guess.
04:43
No, we'll have to change the style.
04:47
Probably. 
04:48
So let's change that. 
04:50
Not horizontally constrained, so let's just constrain that horizontally as well.
05:03
OK.
05:12
Now.
05:14
That's OK.
05:16
That wasn't, that wasn't really a border. 
05:18
It was simply like just because we have selected the element anyways. 
05:22
So we have some issues here. 
05:24
We'll sort those out first. 
05:26
It says content description for the image is missing. 
05:29
Yes, we need to add the image content description. 
05:32
You can. 
05:33
We'll just switch to a code and do it.
05:36
So.
05:39
Image we need to add the content description.
05:48
This one is the background image.
06:02
So I had it hardcoded already.
06:05
And then we made this Alice call it a rectangle just for the sake of.
06:12
What writing so?
06:24
It's hardcoded this as well.
06:29
Let's have a look at any other problems that we might have. 
06:33
The view isn't constrained the button, we have not constrained it yet, so let's do that as well. 
06:40
So you might forget a lot of things and then it will remind you that you didn't do that. 
06:46
So now.
06:49
Get it done.
06:51
OK.
06:53
Constrained.
06:55
Then we need to hard code a lot of strings.
06:59
Missing autofill.
07:02
Hints.
07:17
OK, we don't want to auto fill this though it will display those dots dots dots.
07:24
I mean, so we'll just let it go for now. 
07:27
We'll although we'll hardcode these strings here.
07:31
So let's just hard code these.
07:35
Yeah, we get it by now. 
07:36
We have done this a lot, so log in as well.
07:44
So there we go. 
07:45
I don't think we have many problems here.
07:48
So it says something is too small.
07:52
Fix it.
07:53
Change the height so it's just giving us suggestions that what could be wrong.
08:00
So we are just adjusting the size automatically. 
08:03
We'll just let it adjust.
08:06
So.
08:09
Um, color contrast. 
08:10
Well, we like it like that, so it's fine.
08:14
So yes, there will be a lot of suggestions that will get you where you can follow it or not. 
08:21
That's fine. 
08:21
Now this is our GUI, so that would be it for this video we made the GUI and in the next one we will be logging in and we'll be just checking the username and password that's entered by the user.
08:35
And act accordingly. 
08:36
So let's see.
<---------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 2-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 3-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page. 
00:05
A few things have changed since the last video. 
00:08
I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once. 
00:13
We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the.
00:20
Plaintext. 
00:20
So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one. 
00:25
So nothing new in that and then.
00:28
The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error. 
00:34
Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it. 
00:41
This is. 
00:42
These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own.
00:48
We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login. 
00:53
Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here. 
00:56
So we'll be.
00:59
I will be declaring these.
01:02
Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course. 
01:05
So then let's just do that.
01:13
This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
01:18
Password.
01:32
And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
01:37
Button. 
01:37
I call it importing, you can call it declaring. 
01:41
I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button.
01:48
Will declare that here as well.
01:51
We call it button simply.
01:55
And find view.
01:58
By ID.
02:00
And the ID is log in.
02:04
Button.
02:07
So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
02:16
On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username. 
02:24
So for that the if else would finally be used.
02:29
That we've learned previously in Java. 
02:32
So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
02:38
Username is.
02:41
What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
02:55
And then equals.
02:58
Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
03:07
It to be as and let's do the same. 
03:10
I'll just copy this one right here.
03:28
OK.
03:36
Let's just have.
03:39
These brackets separating them as well.
03:43
Just to keep it organized.
03:47
OK.
03:50
So now we'll be using this.
03:54
Widget here it's called toast, so it will be. 
03:58
You'll see it when you when we try and run it. 
04:03
So toast dot make text. 
04:05
Here goes the current activity we are on. 
04:09
We are on main activity dot this. 
04:12
As informed previously that would be the.
04:15
Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text. 
04:22
So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
04:28
Successful.
04:36
And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long. 
04:43
And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen. 
04:50
Similarly else.
04:53
Here we will be.
05:04
OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing. 
05:10
Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
05:16
Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
05:21
Or invalid, I'll just write them.
05:25
In valid.
05:31
Input.
05:34
Anything like that? 
05:36
OK, so that would be it. 
05:38
We declared all three variables here. 
05:41
This one is for username.
05:44
This one is.
05:46
For the password.
05:50
This one is the button.
05:56
This is the setting up the on click listener.
06:07
This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input. 
06:17
And let's get straight into testing our code. 
06:20
I think we are all set. 
06:23
So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.
<------------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 4-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page. 
00:05
A few things have changed since the last video. 
00:08
I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once. 
00:13
We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the.
00:20
Plaintext. 
00:20
So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one. 
00:25
So nothing new in that and then.
00:28
The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error. 
00:34
Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it. 
00:41
This is. 
00:42
These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own.
00:48
We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login. 
00:53
Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here. 
00:56
So we'll be.
00:59
I will be declaring these.
01:02
Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course. 
01:05
So then let's just do that.
01:13
This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
01:18
Password.
01:32
And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
01:37
Button. 
01:37
I call it importing, you can call it declaring. 
01:41
I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button.
01:48
Will declare that here as well.
01:51
We call it button simply.
01:55
And find view.
01:58
By ID.
02:00
And the ID is log in.
02:04
Button.
02:07
So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
02:16
On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username. 
02:24
So for that the if else would finally be used.
02:29
That we've learned previously in Java. 
02:32
So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
02:38
Username is.
02:41
What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
02:55
And then equals.
02:58
Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
03:07
It to be as and let's do the same. 
03:10
I'll just copy this one right here.
03:28
OK.
03:36
Let's just have.
03:39
These brackets separating them as well.
03:43
Just to keep it organized.
03:47
OK.
03:50
So now we'll be using this.
03:54
Widget here it's called toast, so it will be. 
03:58
You'll see it when you when we try and run it. 
04:03
So toast dot make text. 
04:05
Here goes the current activity we are on. 
04:09
We are on main activity dot this. 
04:12
As informed previously that would be the.
04:15
Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text. 
04:22
So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
04:28
Successful.
04:36
And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long. 
04:43
And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen. 
04:50
Similarly else.
04:53
Here we will be.
05:04
OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing. 
05:10
Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
05:16
Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
05:21
Or invalid, I'll just write them.
05:25
In valid.
05:31
Input.
05:34
Anything like that? 
05:36
OK, so that would be it. 
05:38
We declared all three variables here. 
05:41
This one is for username.
05:44
This one is.
05:46
For the password.
05:50
This one is the button.
05:56
This is the setting up the on click listener.
06:07
This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input. 
06:17
And let's get straight into testing our code. 
06:20
I think we are all set. 
06:23
So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.
<------------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 5-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 6-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students, welcome to another video and here we will be understanding what is an activity in Android Studios. 
00:06
We'll be seeing it in our Android Studio shortly, but before that, let's discuss what it is exactly. 
00:13
So it is just like a page. 
00:16
So you might have seen that we have different pages.
00:20
On each and every application that we come across, for example.
00:26
This taking example of Instagram. 
00:28
So we have a login page right here. 
00:32
It is one activity. 
00:34
Then we have another page right here. 
00:38
After you login into a page, after you enter your credentials here and you click on login.
00:46
It logs in and takes you to the home page. 
00:51
Here you have various options. 
00:53
You have some menus at the bottom which you can click. 
00:57
Here you have messages, so you can also click on stories. 
01:02
This is a main feed right here. 
01:05
So we have various elements.
01:07
To each and every page. 
01:09
Now how an Android application works is that. 
01:12
Just taking an example of this one itself, we have a login page of Instagram. 
01:17
It has various elements. 
01:19
You can see that it has looking at it from a developer's point of view, not a user's point of view. 
01:26
So.
01:27
So as a developer you would have a lot of things. 
01:32
Here we have a logo, here we have a language selector, we have login text boxes where they enter the text. 
01:41
Then we have a forgot your password? 
01:45
It is definitely a link.
01:47
A web link. 
01:48
Then similarly we have a login button. 
01:51
So now whenever you see this, what happens is how do we define it here? 
01:57
So when we have, whenever the user enters anything here credentials and clicks on the login page, the form is first validated, so it's checked.
02:07
Whether or not you have entered your ID and password in the correct format or not, and then later on the after the after it has checked that username and password is correct, it is directly linked to this page, your home page. 
02:26
So now that means that the.
02:28
Link Direct link between these two pages is this login button.
02:34
Similarly, let's have a look at this page right here. 
02:39
Now here we have various elements. 
02:42
That means. 
02:43
Well, that means that this is 1 activity. 
02:47
This is another activity, and.
02:50
Let's say one wants to open the messages. 
02:53
So whenever you open a message, there's a pop up, There's a new pop up here, either a pop up or a whole new different page with no elements of the previous page. 
03:05
So that is another activity. 
03:07
And that means that each and every element, each and every.
03:12
Place right in on the page is connected or is connected to a different activity. 
03:20
So that means that whenever I click on this, it will open my profile that is another activity. 
03:29
In this manner every element.
03:32
Is connected to an activity and these activities we have as we have various activities in app would be full of so many activities. 
03:41
It is just like a collection of activities. 
03:44
So that is what an activity is. 
03:47
You have to understand this. 
03:49
It is very important concept. 
03:51
We cannot move on until.
03:53
And unless this concept is clear of activity, take it as a page simply to move from one each and each and every element. 
04:02
If an element is functional, you click on it and anything opens. 
04:07
That means it is taking you from one activity to another. 
04:11
And to do so, what do we use?
04:14
Well, we used this thing mentioned right here, Intent. 
04:18
Intent is a class in Java that helps us to move from one activity to another. 
04:24
So we'll be using Intent and understanding it. 
04:27
In the next video, we'll be moving from one activity to another as well.
04:34
And later on, it will help us in our project. 
04:38
Understanding of this is very important again. 
04:42
So we'll do it practically here. 
04:44
Hope you've understood the theoretical point of view of the activity. 
04:49
So let's meet in the next video. 
04:52
Till then, make sure.
04:54
That these concepts are clear and let's move, OK?
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 7-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Since welcome to another video and here we will be understanding how to move from one activity to another and let's get started straight away. 
00:09
I have an empty activity. 
00:10
I removed the default hello world from here. 
00:13
So firstly the steps would be quite simple. 
00:16
Let me add a text here. 
00:18
So I'm just dragging and dropping a text.
00:22
And here I want to enter you are on the first activity.
00:32
So that will tell us the activity that we are on. 
00:36
Let me.
00:37
Adjusted somewhere in the middle. 
00:40
Let me just adjust it above it. 
00:44
OK, so let me constrain that as well and then.
00:52
I'll give it OK text view one. 
00:55
We will keep it as it is. 
00:58
Now I have added this. 
01:00
Then let's add another number, I mean another button and.
01:05
Without the text here.
01:08
Activity 2. 
01:09
So whenever I want to move to the activity 2, I would be clicking on this button right here. 
01:17
So we are all set. 
01:19
This is our first page activity. 
01:22
Let me just hard code this string right here.
01:29
And done.
01:32
We have another problem.
01:36
We need to constraint the button, yes. 
01:40
Let's constraint it as well. 
01:43
So done.
01:45
OK, so now.
01:49
We can copy these two as well.
01:52
I hope.
01:59
Copy OK, now let's define another activity. 
02:02
To do that just right click here next and then click on activity. 
02:07
You need to add a new activity. 
02:10
We will choose a an empty activity.
02:18
And it says.
02:23
OK, so now.
02:26
Let's.
02:28
So these two files right here are of activity two. 
02:31
Let me move the one that's for activity 1. 
02:34
So this is the GUI for activity 1 and this is the Java file. 
02:39
This is the activity for.
02:42
The second activity. 
02:43
So I've pasted everything here. 
02:46
Let me just.
02:48
OK.
02:50
Umm.
02:53
I think that was a bad idea. 
02:55
I should have done it from scratch anyhow, so.
03:00
Let's just keep it where these were so.
03:05
282 and 112.
03:20
So done with that.
03:23
Another button.
03:30
So whenever I want to move to Activity 1 back, I'll be using this.
03:37
Let me check constraints for this one as well.
03:41
So it says.
03:46
85 and 15.
04:12
You can constraint it like this as well, just like it was done so.
04:40
We'll call it 15.
04:44
OK, it's already 15. 
04:47
Nope, here. 
04:48
OK.
04:52
Done. 
04:53
So we are all set with the GUI for the.
04:58
First one we can see that we have ur on the first activity. 
05:03
For the second one let me just change it to you or on the second activity.
05:16
Let me hardcode that as well.
05:29
So we are done.
05:32
There's some warning here as well. 
05:35
Yes, let's hardcode this.
05:38
OK, so we are done. 
05:40
So we are done with the GUI. 
05:43
Now it's time to connect these to move from one activity to another. 
05:47
Every time the user clicks on this button right here, activity two, let me check the ID. 
05:54
It's simply button, so I'll copy it and now I'll declare the button right here.
06:00
Any time it's clicked, we'll be using the intent.
06:12
So let's.
06:22
Let's set the onclick listener.
06:29
And there you go. 
06:30
So here, now this part right here is very, very important. 
06:33
Now here we will be creating object of the Intent class. 
06:37
You can name it anything. 
06:38
Very, very important. 
06:39
Just pay attention. 
06:40
We have set up the onclick listener on the button. 
06:43
So now here what we'll be doing is first let's import it.
06:48
OK now we have created an object you can give it any name then new intent here this part. 
06:56
OK now here the first argument that goes into this one is the name of the current activity you are at. 
07:05
We are at main activity.
07:09
So this one goes here dot this. 
07:12
So the extension that we'll be using here is dot this then main activity .2 is the target and the extension that it will have is dot class. 
07:24
So intent create an object of that then.
07:29
In the intent goes to arguments. 
07:30
The first one would be the current activity main activity. 
07:34
The extension that you need to add is dot this and then in the second one would be the target, the extension would be dot class. 
07:42
Now simply all you need to do is start activity.
07:48
And then you will pass the object that you created. 
07:53
So that would be it. 
07:55
Simply this is the function. 
07:57
Let me copy the same.
08:01
And paste it in the.
08:04
Second one.
08:07
So we have. 
08:07
I hope we have the same ID.
08:11
No, it's called. 
08:12
Let me call it button.
08:16
OK, it already exists. 
08:18
There's some issue.
08:20
Leave it, we'll give it.
08:24
Button.
08:28
OK, so let's give it.
08:35
So the ID that we imported is BTN. 
08:39
Anyways other things would remain same except this part right here. 
08:43
Now our target is different and our current activity is actually the activity too. 
08:49
So the extension that would go here would be dot this and then.
08:55
This first activity is the target. 
08:58
So whenever the activity 2 button is clicked, it should move from activity. 
09:04
Sorry activity 1 button is clicked, it should go from activity 2 to activity 1. 
09:11
So let's just.
09:14
And that's the whole process. 
09:17
So we have created.
09:20
Two of these we have created.
09:24
2 interfaces 1 of activity 2 and one of activity one and then we connected it using the intent. 
09:31
So let's execute and see.
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 8-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56
<------------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 9-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students, welcome to another video. 
00:01
And here we'll be understanding how to make these buttons and any elements in the GUI functional. 
00:07
So it should do something when you click on a button. 
00:10
So what we want to do is we want this button to hide the background image whenever I click on it. 
00:17
So how do I do that well?
00:20
On this hide button and then.
00:23
It already has an ID. 
00:24
This background as well has an ID. 
00:27
So just click on the hide button right here and the attribute. 
00:30
You can always explore the attributes, but here the one that we are concerned with right now is called onclick. 
00:37
We'll be coming back to it in a bit. 
00:40
Now on click means that I will be defining a function.
00:44
And I'll put in the name of that function. 
00:46
Whenever the user clicks on this button, it will work according to what is defined in that function. 
00:52
And that function will be defined in the dot Java file. 
00:55
Now let's define a function to do the same, so public.
01:00
Void.
01:02
Let me give it a name, I'll just call it hide background.
01:09
Now, so this is the format that you need to follow. 
01:13
I'll be writing view and then view.
01:20
Now here what you need to do is alt enter. 
01:23
That is because you do not, you have not imported the package that was required. 
01:28
And similarly you will define a button here again it shows in red. 
01:32
That means we haven't imported the class. 
01:34
So alt enter button. 
01:35
You can give it any name, I'll just give it B.
01:39
Equal to.
01:42
Find view by ID.
01:49
R dot.
01:51
ID.
01:52
Dot DID.
01:56
So we have successfully gotten the button right here. 
01:59
So whenever actually you don't have to. 
02:02
I'm just telling you that if you want to import the button, in this case we do not need the button we want. 
02:10
We are concerned with the background image. 
02:13
So for that you'll be doing a similar thing image.
02:16
Menu.
02:20
Equal to.
02:29
I'll just give it a name image.
02:33
I think I misspelled it.
02:35
It's.
02:37
Image view. 
02:38
Yes it is image view.
02:41
OK, we have it imported anyways, so now find view.
02:45
You'll be using the same method right here R dot.
02:50
ID let me copy the ID from here.
02:58
It's this ID. 
03:00
I'll be typing it in here. 
03:03
dot DID.
03:07
Now what I want is this is how you import a button, how you import an image, how you import a text view as well anything. 
03:15
So let me just raise this one. 
03:17
We do need a button. 
03:18
Let me.
03:20
Take this off as well. 
03:22
So now whenever.
03:25
This button is clicked. 
03:28
I want it to.
03:31
Go to this.
03:34
Method right here, so I'll just type in here. 
03:37
Let me open a split window.
03:42
So you can also see it side by side on click.
03:50
So I'm giving it.
03:54
You can also choose it from the list.
03:56
So this right here.
04:01
Is hide background now image named it image. 
04:04
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a simple thing image dot set visibility.
04:14
And here I'm going to set it to invisible.
04:27
So I have set it to invisible image. 
04:30
I have imported the image, I've set it to image dot set visibility view invisible also you can also make it visible. 
04:38
I've made it invisible. 
04:40
So what it will do is.
04:43
Anytime we click on this button right here, it will search for this function and it will find it here. 
04:51
In this function we have defined the image view.
04:55
We have gotten it using the ID which is background image. 
04:59
I've named it image. 
05:00
Then I have used the same variable and set its visibility to invisible.
05:06
In that way, whenever I click on this button it will.
05:12
It will just simply hide the background. 
05:15
So let's just test it on my phone. 
05:17
I'll just run it and open it in my phone. 
05:21
Let's see.
05:24
OK, I connected my phone and let's run it and I'll be switching to my phone now.
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 10-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Students, welcome to another video and here we will be doing the GUI. 
00:05
So we'll be understanding various parts of the GUI. 
00:09
Let's have a look at it. 
00:11
So a few elements that I want to introduce you to. 
00:15
This is a shortcut, I would say menu bar where you can.
00:20
We'll be using it in a while. 
00:23
So this is to hide or see the margins or the constraints. 
00:27
So and here we have a palette. 
00:30
Palette as in we have the common ones we can just drag and drop here, for example, let's just see this. 
00:37
So this is a button you can just.
00:40
Drag and drop it and just delete it for now. 
00:44
So you can delete it using the delete key from your keyboard. 
00:48
Just click on it and delete. 
00:50
And this is how we'll be doing it. 
00:53
You can also call it in a split window or the code window. 
00:58
So this right here, text view, this portion right here.
01:02
Is for this hello world text right here it shows the layout width and the height. 
01:07
So wrap content as in. 
01:09
If the content is more it would stretch out a little bit. 
01:13
If we increase the size of the text it would increase the height so it will be the wrapping the content.
01:21
And then Android text is equal to hello world. 
01:24
So we have a text here. 
01:26
If you want to change it, say I want to change it to.
01:31
I'll just change it to element.
01:37
So then you can see it has changed the text to the element. 
01:41
And then we have these 4 constraints. 
01:43
We'll be understanding those in detail right here. 
01:46
So let's just switch to the design.
01:49
Mode you can see we have a constraint layout here. 
01:53
What do we mean by constraint layout? 
01:55
So if you click on this element you can see these spring like structures on all four sides. 
02:02
So these are called constraints. 
02:04
You can simply take them as springs. 
02:06
So it is just like a spring so.
02:09
Let me just remove all these constraints. 
02:11
You can just clear it from here. 
02:14
Yes, so it says clear all constraints. 
02:16
It's also showing me a warning that it lacks constraints. 
02:19
If I click here, I can see so no. 
02:22
It's for the hardcoded text anyways, so you need constraints. 
02:25
Why do we need constraints? 
02:27
I'll be explaining it in a bit.
02:30
But before that.
02:32
Let's see how to add constraints so you can simply.
02:36
Uh, click on the circle right here and give it a horizontal top constraint and the bottom one. 
02:43
I'll just show it in a split window right here so you can see.
02:49
It has a top constraint.
02:52
Let me just add another one.
02:54
So you can see it keeps on adding the constraints.
02:58
And this One South due to this, what happens is you can see it's at the bottom of the parent.
03:06
Everywhere it mentions the parent here parent means the full screen right here. 
03:10
So if I click on it, what happens is that it will be in the middle of the parent and the bottom, parents top and the parents bottom which is right here. 
03:22
So this is how constraints work. 
03:25
Let's see why.
03:26
Do we need constraints? 
03:27
So what if I do not have a constraint? 
03:31
I just let me just remove all these constraints here. 
03:35
What will happen is that this element right here can appear in different places on the screen. 
03:42
So that would be a problem as you know that we keep.
03:47
As you know we an application is not run in a single kind of screen size. 
03:54
So anytime anything changes, the screen size changes. 
03:57
It has to adjust, it has to be responsive. 
04:01
So let's say if the screen size is smaller, the elements should actually adjust themselves.
04:07
Accordingly. 
04:08
So that is why we use constraints. 
04:11
Let me just drag another text view element.
04:15
Let's just call this element one. 
04:17
I'll call this element 2 to change it. 
04:20
What you will be doing is you can simply click on it and here you have this attributes tab. 
04:26
It works similar to the way that the code works. 
04:29
You can also make all these changes in the code so you can also see the constraint.
04:35
Layout here. 
04:36
Here it says plus, so we do not have any constraints added. 
04:40
I'll just delete it anyways. 
04:42
So let me name this element one. 
04:45
I'll just call it element 1.
04:48
And.
04:50
I'll call this.
04:52
Element 2 I'm just changing the text.
04:57
So these are the two elements right here.
05:01
Let me just.
05:04
Let me just change the height and width to wrap content.
05:10
OK, so there we have element 1 and element 2. 
05:13
As you can see, they do not have any constraints. 
05:16
You can just click on it and you'll see no constraints.
05:20
Now here what I'll be doing Well let's say this is a text and this is some button. 
05:28
We are we have it on our login screen let's say. 
05:32
So I always want the element to below the element 1 so.
05:38
What I'll be doing is let me just give it a.
05:43
Horizontal constraint and let me give this one a horizontal constraint as well. 
05:48
Now what I'm doing here.
05:52
So I'll give it a bottom constraint as well.
05:56
There you go, I'm giving it.
06:01
A top constraint.
06:05
OK.
06:07
Yes, no. 
06:08
OK, Now what I'm doing is I'll just tie both these here.
06:15
Sorry.
06:17
I'll just tie the element 2 to element one with the constraint.
06:24
OK. 
06:25
And there you go.
06:27
OK Oh my God, it's so.
06:30
Yes.
06:33
Let me just.
06:36
It's not that hard though. 
06:38
OK, so now with that, what happens is you can see element one right here. 
06:44
It does not have a bottom constraint. 
06:47
Element 2 has all the constraints and you can see that element 2 is tied up between the element 1 and element.
06:56
So it will always be in between.
07:01
It will always be in between the element 1 and element 2. 
07:06
So it doesn't matter if we change the screen size changes or anything, the orientation or the relative position of these elements remain. 
07:16
So element 2 would always be in the middle of the element 1 and.
07:22
Hit bottom as you can see.
07:25
The bottom constraint, the bottom of text view 2 is the top constraint of element 2. 
07:31
So this is how it works. 
07:33
So This is why we use elements so that we can relate.
07:40
Keep a check on the relative position of all the elements even if the size or anything like that changes. 
07:47
So that would be it for now. 
07:50
This is what we mean by constraint layout. 
07:53
You have other options right here Constraint layout, then we have linear layout. 
07:57
You could use multiple layouts otherwise but.
08:00
If you are using the constraint layout then it would remove all other layouts that are used as sub layouts. 
08:07
So we cannot use multiple layouts there. 
08:10
If you are using constraint layout it will be the only one layout that is being used so that would be it for the layout. 
08:18
You don't have to understand the other ones.
08:21
The constraint layout is a very good layout and it works well with everything. 
08:27
So that is the one that we'll be using here and let's meet in the next video. 
08:33
We'll be understanding a few more things about the GUI.
<-----------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 11-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Welcome to another video and here we will be understanding a few more elements of the GUI. 
00:06
So let's start with importing an image. 
00:09
So what if I want a background image right here? 
00:13
So let me just delete this one right here. 
00:16
And I want an image, so just let me.
00:21
Let me find image view is the element that we use. 
00:25
Now once I drag and drop here I can see this. 
00:30
There are some predefined ones right here. 
00:33
I want to import an image. 
00:36
So let's click on this plus icon and import drawables.
00:43
And here we can import any image we want to. 
00:47
Let me just find one that's on the desktop.
00:57
I have a few here as well, let me just import one for you.
01:06
So I have this one right here. 
01:09
Just click on next.
01:11
Import.
01:14
And there you can see that we have this image right here.
01:19
This so now if I try drag and drop I can find this picture.
01:27
And I can put it here.
01:32
As the background. 
01:33
So this is how you import any image you want to use as a background. 
01:39
Let me let me get a little bit of a neutral background right here so I had one open right here. 
01:47
Just let me just reload it so well, whenever you use any image, make sure.
01:52
It's simple, simply royalty free so you can just use it.
02:00
Never use images that belong to somebody else while you were doing a project. 
02:05
Keep this in practice. 
02:06
Let me just find a little bit of a neutral 1. 
02:10
I think this one's OK. 
02:11
This one seems fine.
02:15
And let's download it. 
02:16
I'll just put it in that folder itself.
02:21
I think I had one right here.
02:24
It's the same one I downloaded previously as well anyways, so here I'll just paste this one. 
02:30
Let me just name it.
02:33
New.
02:35
Background. 
02:35
I'll just give it a random name and save it.
02:40
Let me just close this one.
02:46
OK, let me delete it. 
02:48
You can also paste it here. 
02:51
Simply you can drag and paste it in this drawables folder. 
02:56
You can locate it resources and then open the drawable. 
03:00
Here you can just simply drag and drop.
03:04
I'll just import it like I did previously so.
03:09
Import drawables from the same one. 
03:12
It hasn't updated it. 
03:13
OK it has. 
03:15
There you go. 
03:16
New background and both make sure it's not too much.
03:22
High in quality. 
03:24
Sometimes it rejects it as well, so that might be sometimes an issue. 
03:30
So I have it here. 
03:32
OK, use it.
03:39
Adjust it here. 
03:41
OK, hold on.
03:45
Let me just.
03:47
Make it a bit bigger.
03:49
I don't think I chose a very nice background, but just for, just for, you know, practice, we'll be using a better one when we do the project. 
04:00
OK, so now here it shows me a problem. 
04:04
Let's see what the problem is. 
04:06
It's missing constraints. 
04:07
Let's put the constraints here.
04:09
Then.
04:16
You can only use. 
04:18
Probably you can only use the horizontal constraints, that is also fine. 
04:23
And now I'll just give it an ID, so that is how it will be recognized background.
04:32
Image.
04:34
Now let's make it a bit responsive as in responsive I mean something should happen when I let me just give it a smaller name BG ID, I mean BG image. 
04:48
OK so now.
04:51
This ID is definitely important.
04:57
We have adjusted the background here.
05:00
So this is how you will be importing an image. 
05:03
We'll just add a button here and then we'll finish off. 
05:06
We'll do the rest in the next video S Let's just add a button here. 
05:11
I'll add. 
05:12
I'll drag a button here.
05:21
OK, now.
05:29
OK, there you go, finally. 
05:30
So, so just click on it. 
05:33
I'll open the attributes right here.
05:36
So I'll just give it a name.
05:40
I mean a name as in the text, so I'll call it hide.
05:47
And we need to give it constraints as well. 
05:50
Again, it says constraints are missing, so you can just simply click on this button now. 
05:55
It says hard coded string anyway, you don't have to worry about it, it's just a warning. 
06:01
We'll fix it though, so I'm just naming it hide.
06:05
Let me just drag it to the middle of the screen. 
06:10
Now what I wanna do is.
06:13
I'm I'm making it a very simple 1 so I'm going to do one thing here. 
06:18
I want to hide this background. 
06:21
I just want this background to vanish whenever I click on this button. 
06:25
So I want it to be responsive. 
06:27
Let's see how to do it in the next video we have made the GUI.
06:33
For this and we'll see how to do it in two different ways. 
06:37
One that's a little bit outdated, it was used previously. 
06:41
Another one would be the one that is used nowadays, the one that works with each and every application. 
06:47
I will have a look on both the methods and let's meet in the next video.
<------------------------------------------Mobile-app-Video 12-------------------------------------------------------------------->
Welcome to another course here. 
00:02
The course is known as Application Development Using Android Studio. 
00:07
So we'll be developing a mobile application or basically learning how to develop a mobile application using Android Studio. 
00:15
The language that we'll be employing here would be.
00:20
Java. 
00:20
So let's just start with the introduction of what Java is. 
00:24
Although you should previously have read about Java, and you should know certain basic concepts of Java before you dive into this one. 
00:33
So just for the introduction sake, we'll discuss what Java is. 
00:38
Well, Java is an object.
00:40
Blended programming language. 
00:41
It is employed at various projects like Android application development and web-based applications, mobile games and so on. 
00:50
Android application development is what we'd be doing today or we'll be learning about it today and Android Studio.
01:00
So what is Android Studio? 
01:02
Well, it is an IDE. 
01:05
IDE basically integrated development environment. 
01:07
It is a software where you can program an Android application and run it, test it, develop it. 
01:16
Simply speaking, now the languages that are employed.
01:20
For this purpose could be Java, C, Kotlin. 
01:24
Android Studio supports all three of them. 
01:27
Java and C were previously supported and later on Kotlin was added as well. 
01:33
Java is the most preferred language to make Android studios and the second one would be.
01:41
Portland second one second most preferred 1 S that is about Java and Android studios. 
01:48
Now before we dive into this course, you Start learning new things In this course you will require some basic prior knowledge about Java before we actually Start learning.
02:01
Or coding actually. 
02:02
So in this one what you will require is you would need to know what objects and classes are in Java, how to define them. 
02:11
Now I have made a checklist for you. 
02:14
You can take a screenshot, you can just pause it. 
02:17
Right here. 
02:18
You can learn about each and every concept individually.
02:21
Or you can take up another course. 
02:24
If you do not know all these things you can take apart another course that's called Basics of Java. 
02:30
So that would work for you as well. 
02:33
Now the concept that you need to know need to know are objects in classes. 
02:37
Then you would require to know variables and constants, how to declare variables.
02:42
4th 1 would be data types and conversions. 
02:45
You must know data types such as you should know int, float, double.
02:51
Uh, character string. 
02:52
So all these data types must be known to you. 
02:55
How to convert from one data type to another is also very often employed here, so you must know that as well. 
03:02
Later on you would know operators. 
03:04
Very basic concept of each and every language. 
03:07
You should know what operators can be used in Java.
03:11
Then another concept, control statements. 
03:13
Now these control statements are definitely very important while you are coding because that would decide the flow of your program. 
03:23
So anything that we want to do, any decision making that we will be doing would be done through these.
03:32
Now uh conditional statements if else statements if else, if nested if switch case would be required then the other concept loops loop 3 loop that would be for loop, while loop and do while loop those would be required jump statements these can be.
03:52
Kept is optional. 
03:53
You can learn about these or not because generally jump statements are not considered very. 
04:00
They work though, but they're not very considered considered very reliable. 
04:05
So the two statements that jump statements would be break statement and continue statements then.
04:12
Very important concept. 
04:13
Functions. 
04:13
So you need to be very thorough with the functions or methods. 
04:17
Same thing. 
04:18
So functions. 
04:19
You need to know how to define a function. 
04:22
You must know how to call a function by value as well as reference later on. 
04:27
Last second you should know how to work with strings, how to declare a string.
04:33
And just know a few basic predefined functions that are already there in Java to work with strings and how to use them. 
04:42
Last but not least, packages you must know you for now, as this course is a bit basic, you would not really require to know how to define new packages.
04:54
But you would definitely need to know how to use the ones that are already available. 
05:00
So importing packages, how to import them, how to use them must be known to you. 
05:07
Because sometimes we are using certain concepts in our development while we are coding and it does not really recognize it.
05:16
That's when the package being imported is missing. 
05:18
So one must know how to import and pack a package as well. 
05:23
So these are the concepts that would be required.
05:27
Now, the things that we learned here is that what Java is, what Android studios are, and what would be the prerequisite knowledge about Java that you require before starting this course. 
05:41
So get prepared and in the next video we'll be learning how to.
05:47
Install Android Studios.
