(0:00) Okay, now let's make it more interactive. (0:04) Let's take input from the user (0:06) rather than us deciding what we want (0:09) the variables value to be, what should be the number. (0:13) Let's ask the user what is their choice.
(0:16) Let's make the results dependent on what user chooses to do. (0:21) So in that case, we have a lot of classes, (0:25) a lot of different ways to get an input (0:27) from the user on the command line. (0:29) But here we are going to use scanner class.
(0:32) Scanner class is available in java.util. (0:35) So definitely we'll be importing that package. (0:38) And here we'll create these two lines are quite important. (0:42) First of all, we'll create an object of the scanner class.
(0:46) So it says scanner obj, you can give it any name (0:49) equal to new scanner, then system.in (0:53) just to get the input from the user in the command line (0:57) and give it to the scanner class. (1:00) Then int a, int would be the data type, (1:04) a the variable name, equal to whatever name (1:08) you've given to the object. (1:09) Here it's obj, obj.nextint. (1:13) Let's have a look at it in the practical way.
(1:19) So here we have defined a class (1:23) simply user input as its name, (1:26) imported java.util, simply scanner, (1:29) we've created an object of the scanner class. (1:32) Then system.out.println we have shown (1:37) or we've displayed enter a number. (1:39) Now the user should enter the number.
(1:41) Now where does the input go? (1:43) It goes in this variable, int a, you can give it any name, (1:48) int a, next int, I'm sorry, (1:54) you'll need to use the object name, (1:59) obj.nextint, compile it, no syntax errors. (2:05) So what difference does it make? (2:07) It makes a difference there. (2:10) Now they are asking for an input.
(2:15) Enter a number, four, press enter. (2:18) So now we are entering a number. (2:21) Let's make it better.
(2:23) Now let's make the user enter another number. (2:37) Enter another number, we can use the same statement. (2:43) Now we'll print the sum of a and b (3:01) or we can say the sum of both the numbers is, let's see.
(3:32) So how we get input from the user? (3:36) Enter a number, we enter three. (3:38) Enter another number, we enter seven. (3:41) The sum of both the numbers is 10.
(3:44) So now we are in control. (3:45) The user, rather than just using the predefined ones, (3:51) the ones that we've defined in the program, (3:54) we are taking input from the user, (3:56) enter a number, then enter another number, (3:59) then it adds the numbers and gives you the result. (4:02) So input processes it and the output.

(0:01) Okay, so time for making your own project here. We'll just try and incorporate everything that (0:09) we've learned in this course. We'll try and implement it and use it as much as possible, (0:17) all the if-else statements, all the loops, switch case, everything that we've learned, (0:22) we'll try and incorporate it.
So let's start with our project here. We'll have, (0:28) we'll display a menu for the user and then user himself can choose which one, what to do. (0:36) So we'll be giving an option, we'll be giving them, we'll be using switch case here in the (0:42) first one.
Okay, let's start. So like any, any other program, we will start it with main function. (1:00) Now let's define a scanner class, a scanner object, I mean.
So using the scanner class, (1:08) we'll take the input. So as you can see, it's underlined because we have not imported (1:26) java.util. Let's import that now. Here, now let's see.
Let's display a menu for the user. (1:40) We'll do certain things for the user. So enter one to check if a number is even or odd.
Let's (2:12) display three more, two more of these. So the user, the user should enter two to divide two (2:26) numbers. User should enter three to join two strings.
So we've displayed a menu here. (2:42) Let's take in the user's choice. We need to use it with the object.
(3:01) There you have it. Now we've taken user's choice in the choice variable. So it's stored there.
(3:08) We'll be using switch case here. The variable that we'll be using is choice. (3:17) In case the user states one, what should we do? We will call a function called even odd.
(3:32) And then so it's telling us that there's no such function, but we'll be defining it later. So you (3:41) do not need to worry about it. So now even odd, that is first one.
Let's just define the default (3:48) one as well. Default, just in case the user hasn't entered one, it will, this one would be executed (4:11) invalid input. Okay, let's let's have the other two switch cases, other two cases as well.
(4:31) So just keep it aligned. So there's clarity. Then the other one would be divide, (4:41) this one would be join.
So these three functions that we've used, in case the choice is one, (4:52) then even odd would be executed. Make sure you use break. Otherwise, each one of them would be (4:57) executed.
Now, outside this function, let's define another function here. First one would be even (5:05) odd. So as you can see here, we are not passing any arguments.
So we are not passing any arguments (5:24) here while we are calling it. So these brackets are also empty. And there would be no return type (5:31) as well.
We are not returning it we are we are doing everything in this one itself. So you do (5:35) not need to write here in float anything like that you don't have to. So now we'll take an input from (5:46) user.
Let's do that. So we are asking for the user to enter a number you can again, create an object (6:13) here. Now one thing that you need to notice is that we need to create another, another object (6:23) here, we always whenever a variable be a choice.
So if it's declared, its scope is within this (6:32) function only the function that it is defined in is the only place where it's valid. If I try to (6:40) use choice anywhere else, it would not work. So it will work only within this region.
So because (6:49) it's a local variable, just in case I wanted to be global, I'll just define it here, just saying (7:00) not doing it right now. But then if you define it here, then you can use it throughout the class. (7:06) Anyways, so coming back to our function.
Now we'll check if a that the the number that you (7:33) user has entered is odd or even. Let's make an else block here. So we have defined it.
Let's just (8:21) compile it. Before compiling it. Let's comment out these because we haven't really created these (8:28) functions.
So it will show us an error, just comment it out so that it does not interrupt (8:33) the compiling compiled with no error. Let's execute it. So now it's asking us for an input, (8:43) we enter one, it's an even number.
If we try to enter anything else. (8:50) For example, if I try to enter even two here, it's in issues invalid input. So let's do half of (8:59) it.
After this, half of our project is done.

(0:02) Okay, now completing the rest of the project, let's remove these clashes here. (0:13) Okay, now let's define divide first of all, within the same class. (0:20) So again, similar way similarly, public static, again, it would not return anything, then (0:29) divide.
(0:30) And now it will divide numbers, again, it will ask for a number, we can just copy it (0:41) from here, rather than just typing it all again. (0:45) So first, we define a scanner class again, a scanner object again, and then let's just (0:54) take input, enter a number, enter another number. (1:00) Now we can simply, let's define it float as we are going to divide them, there is a high (1:38) possibility that we have to add, we'll have decimal values.
(1:47) So this is how you will do it. (1:55) Okay, compile, we can compile it. (1:59) But before that, just an exception that could actually happen.
(2:04) What if B is entered as zero, if A is entered as zero, it won't be a problem. (2:10) But in case B is entered as zero, it would be a big issue. (2:16) So to deal with it, what we can do is just write, if B is equal equal to zero, then we'll (2:28) print something else, we'll print do not enter zero.
(2:47) So that would help, it's just like throwing out an exception. (2:52) So that would be very helpful. (2:55) Then, if not, then we can simply just print the quotient or the whatever is the output (3:10) after division.
(3:11) So let's try and compile it. (3:14) Although, yes, we haven't defined this one. (3:18) So we'll define it as well.
(3:20) We need to join two strings, and its name should be string. (3:25) So let's just define the last function that we are left with. (3:39) So we'll be taking input from user, again, the same thing.
(3:47) Let's Yeah, we need to take two inputs here. (3:54) So the data type would be string. (3:59) You can also change the name, but it's not mandatory as we do not as this as A and B up (4:08) there was just valid within the method.
(4:11) So you don't have to, it's not really important. (4:17) Okay, enter a string. (4:22) We're going to ask for a string.
(4:28) Yes, it shows some error. (4:31) Okay, yes. (4:36) Okay, we can simply just, okay, just join two strings.
(4:47) So the first string could be Java. (4:58) Just simply join these. (5:01) And the second one could be, now let's display that what both of these are.
(5:37) The first string is str1, str sorry, then the second one. (6:17) So how do we concat it? (6:19) Let's see, str.concat str2. (6:27) You can also use the plus sign here, you can just simply join it without the concat function (6:32) as well.
(6:33) Let's see what's the error here. (6:36) Okay, we did not use, okay, no syntax errors. (6:45) Let's see if everything works.
(7:04) So it shows odd number. (7:06) Then in case we want to divide two numbers, then we'll enter 2, 6, and then 8, 6 and 7. (7:19) So it gives us the output. (7:21) In case we enter 0, let's check that as well.
(7:24) So we entered 2. (7:27) Now enter a number, we enter 6, and then we enter 0. (7:31) Do not enter 0. (7:32) So it shows us that we shouldn't enter 0. (7:35) So it's working perfectly fine. (7:37) Now the last one, to join two strings. (7:41) So it shows us the first string is Java, second one is programming.
(7:44) After concatenation, the string is Java programming. (7:48) You can just give a little space after is, otherwise, it's all right.

OK, so moving further now, we'll understand the if, else, if else statements. 

As you can see in this program we've defined 2 variables. 

We are taking input from the user in the variable A&B.

Now in the first if statement what we are doing is that we are checking if A is greater than B. 

If A is greater than B we'll we'll tell the user the first number is the greater.

Whereas if the case is opposite, if B is greater than A, then we'll say, well, the second number is greater. 

Now the else block contains the last possibility that both numbers are equal. 

So just logically speaking, if A is in greater than, B&B is in greater than.

A. 

Then there's only one possibility, and that is that both are equal.

Find it that we can use as many as if else blocks as much as we want. 

There's no condition placed after else but.

Else if statement just like if has space for expressions that return true or false. 

Now let's check the working compiled. 

Now let's see.

When I enter 5.

It says enter another number, second number is greater.

Let's check if. 

What if we enter both of them?

Six, both are equal. 

So that is how it works. 

Both are equal. 

So this is how if else statement works. 

Now let's close it. 

Let's move on to the second type. 

Now the second type is switch case. 

This is known as switch case.

Nothing different. 

Nothing.

New except this block.

Which I'd be explaining right away. 

Now we defined A variable int day is equal to 3.

Then I use the word switch brackets and then I put in the variable that I want the switch case for.

Then I write various cases when case 1A column.

If the case is 1, by which we mean if the value of day is 1, then it should be Monday. 

Print Monday.

Then I use a break statement. 

Now what break statement does is it would not execute the cases or anything after it. 

No, the control would flow from this line to right outside here after this block. 

So.

After this bracket, the control would flow directly from here to here. 

It will not execute anymore lines of codes in lines of code in the switch case. 

So using a break statement is important. 

It is also called a jump statement.

Now the last one when the case is due then it's Tuesday. 

If it's three then Wednesday. 

Let's suppose that like we we can see here the day is 3 equal to 3:00. 

So it will check this now false wrong. 

Then it will move to case two. 

It won't execute this one because the case is in two.

Then three ohh yes it matches 3 and case 3. 

So it will print Wednesday and break come out of the switch case. 

Now just in case none of them is true, let's suppose the day is 10 or 20 or something. 

Then we have a statement. 

It's called default.

So just in case all of them are false, it will print wrong input.

Let's check it compile.

It shows us Wednesday.

Let's enter 7. 

The day is 7.

The result would be Sunday.

And in case we enter.

In case in case we enter some random number, let's say 800 and 989. 

OK, compile. 

Now none of the cases are equal to 89. 

Let's see the result.

Hence proved that last statement is the one that would be executed. 

That would be wrong input. 

So switch case. 

With switch case a few things. 

We can also use character. 

We can also use a constant expression here for example 6.

Into.

Nine that can be used here. 

So whatever the answer is of this, that would be the case. 

That is what that would be the value that would be the one that compared OK.

Other than that, we can use character data type here. 

But using double for example 8.9897, this is something that's not a feature of switch case. 

We cannot use decimal values here. 

We also cannot use.

Variables like a into B, No, that would be wrong. 

So anything that's constant and is not in decimals can be used.

These are the few rules that we need to follow while using the switch case. 

Further, we'll understand variables in data types in Java. 
00:06
So in Java we have various data types and they have their sizes, specific sizes. 
00:13
For example, for character we have.
00:17
A data type called care. 
00:20
It takes up two bytes in the memory. 
00:23
Byte, like the name suggests it takes 1 byte. 
00:27
Short takes up two bytes. 
00:29
Integer takes up 4, long 8. 
00:32
So you can read it here. 
00:34
Boolean takes one bit.
00:37
Now for a character, we can store ABC any single character. 
00:42
It could be even space, it could be a symbol, a number, just that it should be in double quotes. 
00:51
We'll understand it in this video itself further.
00:57
Byte, short, int and long. 
00:59
All these four data types store integer type values. 
01:05
What do we mean by integer? 
01:08
So it will be two, 3-4, hundred, 122, anything like that But.
01:16
With no decimal spaces float in double. 
01:20
To the contrary, they take values that have decimal spaces, say 6.26.289. 
01:28
Any of those boolean stores two things, either true or false.
01:36
That's all.
01:39
Now have a look at variable declaration and assignment. 
01:43
So this line right here is an example of how to declare a variable. 
01:49
And this is the representation just to understand it better. 
01:53
So I've mentioned the data type, it's float like you can see.
01:59
We have decimal spaces here. 
02:01
A is name of the variable, so of the identifier. 
02:06
You can give it any name then equal to the value. 
02:11
Here float as the data type A is the variable equal to. 
02:16
Is the assignment operator and.
02:19
This is a constant. 
02:21
Again; We need to use after each and every statement in the memory. 
02:26
Just to visualize it a little bit. 
02:28
We have a space, it has its own address. 
02:32
Just just an example. 
02:33
We are giving it a name, that name is A and we are storing a constant.
02:40
In that variable in that space, now we can change. 
02:45
We can change it to any other number. 
02:49
So the name remains same, the location remains same, the constant can keep on changing. 
02:57
We can.
02:59
We can write a equal to 6, so that's when it will erase this one and enter 66.28. 
03:06
Anything we want to, we can overwrite it. 
03:10
Simply speaking. 
03:10
Let's take a look at it how to do this in a program.
03:17
So opening Blue Jay again, we'll create a new class, give it a name, let's give it name sum a simple program here, so.
03:29
Let's start open it.
03:36
It has already been. 
03:37
You can just.
03:41
It is it completely or just simply?
03:45
This right here is also a comment. 
03:48
Anyways, we do not need it, so we've defined a class public class sum now again.
04:12
So here we'll define a variable.
04:17
Keep it very simple. 
04:18
Int a is equal to 2.
04:22
B is equal to 9, so you can separate it with a comma and then later on put a semi column there we want to print the sum of it.
04:32
So it will be.
04:40
We'll just print a plus.
04:44
B.
04:46
So what is happening right here? 
04:48
Plus is also an operator. 
04:50
We'll study it further. 
04:52
We'll study all the operators that are used in Java. 
04:56
So this is the data type. 
04:58
This is name of variable. 
05:00
I've assigned IT12B has the value 9. 
05:03
Then I've printed the sum of A&B.
05:06
So as per our anticipation, the answer should be the sum of 12 and 9. 
05:15
Let's see, compile it, no errors.
05:21
Then just run it.
05:25
So the sum here is 21 as you can see. 
05:29
So this is how to declare a variable, how to use data types and then use it.
OK, so let's have a look at strings. 
00:04
In Java, Strings are nothing but they are text, just like you can see here first how we define a string. 
00:11
It's string just like a data type integer. 
00:14
Then we give it a name and then.
00:17
We assign the value here. 
00:20
Now string is not a upfront straight away. 
00:23
It's not a data type, rather it is. 
00:26
It is a data type, but it's not a primary data type. 
00:32
It's at the back end. 
00:34
It's an array. 
00:35
Now array is nothing but a combination of.
00:39
A data type, so various locations of a data type. 
00:43
So what I mean by that is just like it has been defined here, JVA are characters and it has been combined to make a string. 
00:54
So a string in Java cannot be changed later on, we cannot expand it.
00:59
Because it is defined as an array. 
01:02
Now there are a few functions that we can use with the strings. 
01:06
These are a few. 
01:08
There are a lot more that you can discover on your own.
01:13
Let's dive into it. 
01:14
Let's see how to work with arrays. 
01:17
I mean, sorry, how to work with strings?
01:21
OK, have a look at it. 
01:24
Let's define.
01:29
A class named String use.
01:59
OK, so let's define a string and the string. 
02:03
Why we do not need to import a function or any import a class or anything that is because.
02:12
String is stored in Java Lang which is the default package. 
02:16
So we do not need to import any external package here String let's call it STR we'll call it.
02:26
Java is a language.
02:31
So this is our string. 
02:34
Now how to work with this string we'll first of all we'll display it.
03:05
Let's.
03:07
Let's see the results.
03:13
So the original String is Java is a language.
03:19
Now let's have a look at what we can do with this string.
03:24
So now.
03:29
Let's suppose I want to change it to uppercase. 
03:33
I want all the letters to be capital, so I'll just use a function here STR dot.
03:44
2.
03:45
Upper.
03:47
Case.
03:49
As it's a function, we'll have this. 
03:52
We'll be using dot.
03:55
And.
03:57
We'll also have these.
03:59
Brackets here.
04:02
Let's check.
04:06
Wait.
04:08
The original string is this.
04:12
So.
04:14
The string, we can write it the string.
04:19
In upper case.
04:23
Similarly, we have another one here.
04:32
So it will.
04:34
We'll just write lower here and it will convert it into.
04:40
Lower case.
04:48
OK, we'll see that later. 
04:51
Now we have many other functions that we can use here, the string.
05:05
After replacing.
05:09
Java with.
05:12
Guava.
05:15
OK, now what we'll do here? 
05:17
We'll use a different function.
05:23
Dot replace.
05:25
Now in the first section we will be passing arguments here in Java.
05:31
Cover.
05:34
What we've done here, the first argument is the one that we are looking for the search element. 
05:40
So it will be looking for Java and then replacing it with Kava. 
05:44
Let's execute it and say.
05:51
OK.
05:52
OK.
05:54
Let's compile it. 
05:55
Make sure you keep a check on the semicolons and the brackets and everything.
06:06
OK. 
06:06
And the pop up is here, OK?
06:10
Let's turn it off. 
06:11
Let's try to execute. 
06:13
OK, there you go. 
06:15
So the original string is this, the string in uppercase, the lowercase replacing Java with Carver?
06:23
Let's do something else here now, Carat.
06:28
So we have another one.
06:33
The character.
06:36
Add index.
06:42
3.
06:47
Is.
06:51
Now this one takes the value.
06:56
C should be small OK, so.
07:00
We are looking for character that is at 3. 
07:03
So let me know what you are expecting. 
07:06
What would be the character at third index? 
07:08
The index starts from here.
07:12
At 3rd place, what is the?
07:15
Character. 
07:16
So now the character are third place is a but you would say it's BY. 
07:22
Is it a cause the index starts from zero in a string, so the at 0 it's J, at one it's a second, at second position it's B.
07:35
And 3rd, it is a so this is how it's working. 
07:40
These are a few functions that we can use. 
07:43
We have a few more as well. 
07:46
Let's let's test all of them.
07:53
So we want to know.
07:56
The index.
08:00
Off.
08:02
L.
08:06
So the function for that is.
08:11
Index of.
08:14
And we'll pass.
08:17
And here.
08:26
Index of L is 10, so if you count from here 012345678910, make sure you also count the white spaces in between. 
08:37
They also take up space so you cannot just ignore it. 
08:42
So it won't be like 0123.
08:46
Then we just go to I4 nodes. 
08:48
The space is also counted here. 
08:50
That would be index. 
08:51
So we have various functions like this. 
08:53
You can just keep on trying a few more. 
08:56
You can just have a look at them and just play around with it. 
09:01
It will be easy for you. 
09:03
So this is how we define a string. 
09:05
These are a few functions that we can use.
09:08
With the strings.  

OK, so let's start here. 
00:03
First of all, we'll learn what is the method we've been talking about member functions, functions, methods.
00:12
These all are the same things. 
00:15
It's called method or a function. 
00:17
How to define it? 
00:19
Well you'll need an access specifier. 
00:21
It could be public, private. 
00:23
Then you can use the keyword static. 
00:26
Then the return type. 
00:28
Return type is data type. 
00:30
What kind of value are you going to return?
00:34
Then methods name then list of arguments. 
00:37
So our input goes here and the return type will be defined here. 
00:42
A return keyword would be used within the method in the method body. 
00:47
Then we have how to call a function? 
00:51
Well to call a function simply write the name.
00:55
And in brackets you pass the arguments that you want to. 
00:59
Let's have a look at it how it looks practically.
01:03
So we've defined.
01:05
A simple class here it's called methods. 
01:08
Let's define a function here public.
01:12
Static.
01:16
Let's return into. 
01:17
This time we'll return integer type. 
01:20
It's called add. 
01:22
The functions name is add then.
01:26
String.
01:29
Argument.
01:35
Now further sorry you don't you'll pass on the arguments like int A as we are adding 2SO2 variables int AEA&B return.
01:51
A+.
01:53
B. 
01:53
So you are returning it. 
01:55
What we've done here is this is a class. 
01:58
This is a function that I've defined in that class. 
02:01
Its name is add. 
02:02
OK for now, it won't do anything because we are not calling it anywhere. 
02:07
We are not utilizing it. 
02:08
We are not using it, but when we call it, that is when it will work.
02:14
So let's see.
02:17
Let's create the main function. 
02:19
That's where the execution starts from.
02:33
So what we'll do here is we are simply going to.
02:37
Call this function, it says.
02:42
Let's define a variable should be C Now when we call this function.
02:51
Add we'll pass arguments.
02:56
We passed 22.
02:59
Plus 22.
03:04
So it should return 44.
03:07
So these two arguments, let me just make it a little different. 
03:11
Okay? 
03:11
42 should be the answer. 
03:13
22 goes into A, 20 goes into B. 
03:16
The return word is used in the brackets. 
03:20
We pass whatever we want to return here, so the return would be 42. 
03:25
So C should be equal.
03:27
42 here, then we just print the result.
03:53
So there you go.
03:55
Compiled.
03:57
Let's check what's the output.
04:01
The output is. 
04:03
The sum is 42. 
04:04
So what happened here is that we had a class. 
04:09
We've defined 2 functions. 
04:10
One is the one that adds 2 numbers and returns the sum. 
04:16
We called it here In this way, these arguments are called actual.
04:21
Parameters. 
04:22
These are called formal parameters. 
04:24
You make sure you define the data type here so everything goes smooth. 
04:30
Now let's give it another try. 
04:32
Now let's try something different. 
04:34
What if I try to call it?
04:39
Outside this class. 
04:40
So the class is public, the method is public. 
04:45
Let's try it. 
04:46
OK, let's create another class Create. 
04:49
Let's create it. 
04:51
Here I'm gonna call it.
04:55
Umm.
04:58
Let's call it main.
05:02
And you should notice something that this main and that main are different. 
05:07
Java is.
05:09
Case sensitive. 
05:10
So this mean with starting with a capital letter is different from the other one. 
05:16
OK So what I did here is I pasted the same code. 
05:20
We are trying to call the add function but it shows us an error. 
05:26
It says undeclared method. 
05:27
We do not recognize it.
05:29
We don't know what you're talking about. 
05:32
AD is not a function here. 
05:34
Now what we do about it. 
05:36
So like I told you.
05:39
So as you can see.
05:44
As you can see, this is a different class. 
05:47
This is a different class.
05:50
So whenever we are trying to access members of another class, what we need to do is we'll create an object of that class. 
05:58
So the classes name was methods.
06:07
I'm giving it a name, I'll call it OB now new.
06:15
Methods.
06:18
So I have.
06:20
Created.
06:23
An object.
06:26
Now, when I need to call any member of this class methods that we defined earlier, I'll use the object.
06:38
OB dot whatever is the name of the object, whatever is it, you'll use that. 
06:44
Now let's compile it and it should run. 
06:47
Yes, it compiles. 
06:48
Now one thing you can see here that the main function got connected with the main class got connected with the methods function.
06:58
So a function that's defined in the methods class is being used in the main class, here the add function. 
07:06
As we can see there is no method defined here that is called add, but it is defined in the methods class. 
07:16
So keeping it simple.
07:18
Let's execute it and we want the answer to be 42. 
07:23
We are executing the main class not the other one. 
07:27
The answer remains same that sum is 42 just in case you not.
07:35
Selected this option Clear screen at method call. 
07:38
You might be getting new new outputs with the previous ones still on the console, so you can select this. 
07:47
I think it's pretty late to tell you that, but yes. 
07:51
So clear screen at method calls sometimes by default.
07:55
The screen won't be cleared by the while we execute it. 
08:01
The previous outputs would still be visible. 
08:04
So just select this option. 
08:07
OK yes. 
     Video8     
Hello students so we are going to start our course here which is known as basics of Java.
00:10
So you will be learning basic concepts of Java, how to write a program in Java, perform in various perform various tasks in Java. 
00:20
Before we dive into it, let's start with what Java is exactly. 
00:25
So Java is an object oriented programming language. 
00:28
What we mean by.
00:30
Object Oriented programming language. 
00:32
We'll definitely discuss it just in a bit. 
00:35
But just you should know that Java is an object oriented programming language. 
00:40
There are various other object oriented programming languages. 
00:43
For example, C is one of the examples. 
00:46
Now where do we use Java? 
00:48
Java is used to make Android applications it.
00:51
We used to make web applications mobile games, so it is employed at various.
00:58
Places it's employed in various projects Now a little bit of the history of Java. 
01:05
It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1990. 
01:08
It was originally known as Oak. 
01:11
Later on its name was changed to Java, which was I think based on name of a coffee.
01:19
OK, now let's understand when we say Java is an object oriented programming language, what do we mean exactly? 
01:27
So here there are various basic concepts of Java. 
01:31
But here two major concepts of Java object in the class. 
01:36
Well an object is an instance of class.
01:40
By instance of a classmate we mean that it is just like an example of a class. 
01:46
And what is a class? 
01:47
A class is a blueprint of an object.
01:51
Or just like you can say that a class is just like a template, so a template which can be used to create various objects. 
02:02
So class is a general template of a thing and we can create various objects of it now for example here.
02:11
You can see that a vehicle vehicle is the class here example. 
02:14
Just taking it as an example from our real life. 
02:18
So when we say a vehicle, vehicle has vehicle could be any, it could be an airplane, it could be a train, it could be a car, bus, scooter, any of these. 
02:28
So here we have taken a few examples.
02:31
So here we cycle is a class. 
02:34
So a vehicle will have its own functionality. 
02:37
We know a vehicle can have a maximum speed. 
02:41
Each and every vehicle would have a maximum speed, minimum speed. 
02:46
It will have various other features. 
02:48
How many wheels it has, what?
02:51
Color it is. 
02:52
So all these things come under a vehicle. 
02:56
A vehicle would have some properties. 
02:59
Now when we go in deeper, we'll see a car is the type of a vehicle. 
03:06
Now here we'll see that a car has its own specific details, OK.
03:12
One could be red in color. 
03:14
It has four wheels. 
03:16
Its maximum speed is 120 kilometer per hour. 
03:19
Similarly, a bus has its own properties. 
03:22
A scooter, it has two wheels rather than four. 
03:26
So it has its own properties, but all of them have wheels. 
03:31
OK, so a general.
03:32
Template. 
03:33
A general way of calling them would be a Vehicle. 
03:37
So Vehicle here is a class and all these are its objects.
03:43
No.
03:45
Moving further, what's the difference between an object in a class? 
03:49
You do not have to worry about it if you do not understand it. 
03:53
Now when we do practice it practically while we are coding, you will definitely understand it. 
03:59
So do not worry about it now. 
04:01
Here, just like we discussed, an object is an instance of class.
04:06
A class is a collection of objects, so we can either call it a collection of objects or we can call it a blueprint of an object.
04:14
We can create multiple objects of a single class. 
04:17
So we can also term it as collection of objects. 
04:21
Now as the class is just a template so it does not take up any space on the memory. 
04:28
Whereas when it comes to an object whenever we create an object of a class.
04:34
It does take up space on the memory. 
04:37
Now taking it simply how when it comes to the coding part. 
04:41
So how do we declare a class? 
04:43
How we create a class? 
04:45
So a class starts with class keyword. 
04:47
Then you will give it a name. 
04:50
You can give it any name. 
04:52
I've given it my class, that's the name.
04:55
Then curly brackets open. 
04:56
The content will be included in these curly brackets. 
05:00
That is how we will define a class. 
05:03
Now of the same class, whenever we want to create an object, first of all the name of the class. 
05:10
Whichever class it is, its name would go here. 
05:13
Then object you can give it.
05:16
Any name I've given it obj equal to new. 
05:19
Now new keyword is used here. 
05:22
Then my class again the name of the name of the class round brackets; Make sure you put a semi colon here. 
05:31
There are statements in Java where you have to put I think most of the statements.
05:37
Need a semi colon so you might write a whole code. 
05:41
It's all good, no errors. 
05:43
But a semi colon might cause an issue and you might not be able to execute it. 
05:49
So make sure you put a semi colon there. 
05:52
So that is the basic difference between a class and object, OK?

OK, let's have a look at these jump statements. 
00:04
Now break. 
00:05
We've already seen in the switch case, but we'll just go over it again and continue. 
00:11
These are two jump statements that help us jump from one line of code to the other while the execution is still on.
00:22
So here we have a class, simply we've named it Jump State.
00:28
Let's define a for loop here int I.
00:45
So in normal execution, we'll try.
01:02
We are printing eye here.
01:05
So now simply let's see what it does. 
01:08
So as we've already done it in the loop, it will print numbers zero to 10.
01:16
But now I want to show you how to use. 
01:20
What does a break statement do?
01:23
So if.
01:28
I is equal equal to 5.
01:33
Then.
01:35
Break.
01:38
So what a break statement would do is in case this block is executed, the control from this line would come out of the loop, which means the loop would be terminated. 
01:53
Let's see, although this loop should loop should go on.
01:58
Until it it prints zero to 10. 
02:01
Let's see what happens when we add a break statement here.
02:07
So there you go, 01234 and five. 
02:12
So what happened here is when?
02:16
It was equal to five this statement, this block of code was executed and the control came out of the loop. 
02:26
So it never went back and checked these got incremented or checked the condition to iterate again. 
02:34
No, it was terminated.
02:36
Let's see what a continue statement does so now.
02:42
Working of break statement and a continuous statement are similar but.
02:49
How does it differ?
02:51
Can you notice something here?
02:54
There's something missing 5 is missing here. 
02:58
Why?
03:01
The continuous statement works similar to the break statement. 
03:05
Whenever it's executed, it terminates the loop.
03:09
But sorry, it does not terminate the loop, rather it ignores whatever is after it for one time. 
03:19
So when it was 5, continuous statement was executed and what happened is this line right here was ignored.
03:29
And the iteration and it moves to the next iteration. 
03:35
That is how it works. 
03:38
Breaks statements, simply terminates the loop continuous statement.
03:44
Ignores the part of a loop, a block of set after it, and continues with the next iteration. 
03:52
Whereas that is not true for a break statement. 
03:56
Break statement completely terminates it and never goes back.

So now here we'll understand what are packages in Java. 
00:07
Well packages in Java are a collection of similar classes, interfaces and sub packages. 
00:14
For now you can just take it as these are a collection of classes functions.
00:22
Which can be used now. 
00:24
These are of two types.
00:27
Built in and user defined. 
00:29
So built in packages are those that are already loaded in the compiler in the JDK and you can just use them.
00:39
You don't have to define them, you don't have to define a function, you don't have to define what task this has to perform. 
00:48
You can just import it and use it, as simple as that. 
00:52
And user defined packages are those, We can Group A few classes and we can name it as a package.
01:00
Those are called user defined packages. 
01:03
Now we have a few examples of built-in packages. 
01:07
The examples here are Java dot IO. 
01:11
Now it includes various classes. 
01:14
I've mentioned a few classes here, buffer, reader, input stream, output stream.
01:20
So these are all used while taking an input. 
01:23
Then we have Java Lang. 
01:25
It is a default package, by which I mean that you do not have to import it or explicitly mention that I want to use this package and it's classes in my program. 
01:37
No, you don't have to. 
01:38
All these are already by default loaded.
01:42
Then we have Java dot util. 
01:45
Java dot util contains classes like a Scanner class. 
01:48
Scanner classes used to take input again then date, time zone. 
01:53
So whenever you want to use.
01:57
These kind of classes where you need the time zone and date of a user you can use Java dot util. 
02:06
Then we have Java dot SQL. 
02:08
So it basically like the name suggests SQL. 
02:11
So SQL is used for databases, so it's used for database connectivity.
02:17
We whenever we want to connect our Android or any other application to a database. 
02:24
That is when we use it the Java application whenever it needs the database connectivity. 
02:30
Now let's have a look at how to use these packages in our program.
02:39
Let's start with it. 
02:42
Now packages. 
02:43
So let's define a.
02:47
Class named package use. 
02:48
This is where we'll learn how to use the package.
02:54
So.
02:56
OK.
02:58
So we've defined it. 
03:00
Let's remove.
03:02
Comments and everything that we do not really need here.
03:12
OK.
03:33
So here we've defined it now just for an example.
03:39
Let's say we want to use the Scanner class here Scanner. 
03:44
I'll explain it further later on, but let's say Scanner. 
03:47
It's the name of the class like I told you how to create an object new.
03:56
Scanner here. 
03:57
We can. 
03:58
In the brackets we can pass an argument. 
04:01
We'll be passing system in so that whatever input we get, we get it. 
04:07
We get it to the Scanner class now.
04:11
Scanner class let let me try to use it.
04:15
Now when I'm trying to use it, it's showing me some suggestions and it's telling me that the package or the class, I'm sorry, the class has not been defined. 
04:26
So to do that, like we read earlier, it is present in Java util. 
04:31
So what we'll do is we'll use the keyword.
04:34
Import.
04:38
Then Java dot util dot*; Now when we compile it, it shows no syntax errors, although it won't do anything. 
04:49
We've just created an object and done nothing.
04:55
But this is how it works. 
04:58
So what do we mean by this* So what it does is it will import all the classes that are present in the Java util package. 
05:09
So all the classes be it Scanner class be it any other class.
05:15
It will import it, but just in case we just want a single class, we don't want to use any other we can after the dot, we can just write that single class's name as well. 
05:29
It won't show us any error as we just want to use a specific class from this package.
05:36
So this is how you import any package. 

start_time,end_time,text
0.0,8.7,"Now moving further as we have already understood three types of operators arithmetic, relational"
8.7,9.7,and logical.
9.7,15.38,"Now let us move on to assignment operators, one of which we have already used a simple"
15.38,18.1,equal to we have already used.
18.1,24.54,We can let us understand what are the other operators that have been mentioned in the assignment
24.54,25.54,operator.
25.54,27.54,So let us see.
28.54,35.78,"So simply here we can see that a is equal to 12, that means that 12 is the value of"
35.78,36.78,a.
36.78,41.94,Now we have a different way of overwriting it.
41.94,46.06,So we can overwrite it simply as a is equal to 9.
46.06,54.74,"So now when we try to print a, it will show us 9 rather than 12."
54.74,63.34,So like I said earlier that it raises the previous value now the value of a is 9 as we
63.34,65.46,have printing a.
65.46,71.3,Now let us suppose we want to add a number to a.
71.3,75.7,We want a is equal to a plus 5.
75.7,84.7,Now what do we mean by this that here the result will be as per 12 plus 5.
84.7,93.9,So now a new value would be assigned to a which would be 12 which is a plus 5.
93.9,98.22,12 plus 5 would be 18.
98.22,102.22,Let us compile it.
102.22,108.06,So are we 17 it will be 17.
108.06,112.46,So it has successfully added it.
112.46,121.18,Now rather than doing this what we can simply do is a plus equal to.
121.18,131.86,Now it will work in a similarly it is nothing but it is a is equal to a plus 5.
131.86,139.34,So no difference here we can write it as this or we can write it as this.
139.34,154.3,Now by let again no errors let us run it.
154.3,156.74,I think the terminal is open.
156.74,161.58,So no difference.
161.58,166.74,So that would be assignment operators.
166.74,173.62,So the other operators would also work in a similar way it will subtract multiply divide
173.62,176.3,finding modulus and everything.
176.3,180.5,Now next we have increment and decrement.
180.5,182.74,Let us have a look at this.
182.74,185.9,This is a very interesting operator.
185.9,188.1,So let us see.
188.1,196.7,Now here what I do is I simply write it is a unary operator means we can
196.7,202.38,use it with a single variable we do not need a bc equal to nothing.
202.38,210.9,Now a plus plus what this would do is it will increment the value by 1.
210.9,216.06,So it will add 1 to it.
216.06,220.42,Let us see just yeah.
220.42,223.98,Okay let us have a look at it.
224.02,231.42,So the original value was 12 it has incremented it to 13.
231.42,234.5,But there is a difference.
234.5,238.78,This is something that we need to understand.
238.78,246.54,We can write it as a plus plus or plus plus a.
246.54,249.18,It makes a difference.
249.18,253.74,Now what difference it makes is when we write plus plus a it
253.74,259.94,means that it will increment it increment the value right there and then.
259.94,263.22,So 12 here here the value is 13.
263.22,266.1,So when we print a it is 13.
266.1,276.26,But when we do a plus plus what it does is 12 still here the value is 12.
276.26,282.94,But when it is used the next time that is when the value would be 13.
282.94,285.22,Let me show you a difference.
285.22,294.18,So what I will do is rather than using it here to prove my point I am going to use it here
294.18,297.18,a plus plus.
297.18,306.06,Now let us see what would be the answer would it be 12 or 13 compile it.
306.06,311.18,Let us see.
311.42,314.26,12 still 12.
314.26,323.94,Now if we see it here if I do a plus plus a then compile it.
323.94,324.94,Okay.
324.94,326.94,We need another plus.
326.94,328.94,Okay plus plus a.
328.94,329.94,Okay.
329.94,339.42,If it shows an error here it is just because of the brackets as it is not able to differentiate
339.46,347.18,what is the arguments or what the plus exactly needs to combine just add the brackets here
347.18,348.18,that would help.
348.18,350.18,Okay compile.
350.18,356.7,Now plus plus a means it will do it right then and there it will increment it.
356.7,357.9,13.
357.9,369.38,Same goes for minus minus we use the subtraction sign here what it will do is.
369.38,371.38,The answer would be 11.
371.38,376.86,Now the last one the last one is conditional operator.
376.86,396.94,Now what is the conditional operator just commenting it here conditional operator is this one.
396.94,403.74,Now a question mark how do we use it well it is very interesting.
403.74,411.94,So what we do is let us take a let us just 12 and 9 simple.
411.94,415.3,Let us declare another variable call it result.
415.3,422.1,Now what it will do is it will compare these two and give us a result.
422.1,427.98,Now how result is equal to.
427.98,434.38,Now here is where the expression goes expression we can use the logical operators that
434.38,436.3,we have learned already.
436.3,446.1,A is if A is greater than B then question mark.
446.1,460.42,So we will add a question mark here then true otherwise a column forms.
460.42,470.42,So we need to put it in quotations.
470.42,477.7,Okay result.
477.7,483.54,So what we are doing is just a second.
483.54,498.74,Let us try and combine it.
498.74,509.9,Okay anyways so what we are doing here is if A is greater than B then A would go here.
509.9,517.3,If B is greater than 9 sorry B is greater which means it will return false then we will
517.3,519.58,have B here.
519.58,526.54,So what actually goes here is if the statement if this expression is true if the statement
526.54,534.1,is true then this part would be executed the one before the column if it is false then this
534.1,538.7,part would be executed which is the next part.
538.7,547.26,So now let us see.
547.26,556.98,So now what it does is which so ever number among A or B is the greatest the result would
556.98,558.34,be that.
558.34,566.18,So the bigger number when here the result should be 12 as per us as 12 is greater than
566.18,568.38,9 it should be 12.
568.38,581.06,Let us suppose B was some other number let us say it was 90.
581.06,586.9,Now in this case this expression would be false the second one should be printed the
586.9,593.34,result should contain the second one and the answer would be 90.
593.34,602.34,So these are the operators that we use we used all these operators are mathematical
602.34,608.58,operators relational logical assignment increment and conditional operators.
608.58,610.3,So all of these we understood.


00:06
In this project we explore the Wi-Fi capability of the ESP 32 and understand how it can be used for Internet of Things applications through wireless communication. 
00:16
The ESP 32 comes with built in Wi-Fi, allowing it to connect to a local wireless.
00:21
Network and exchange data with other devices First, the program initializes the Wi-Fi module by setting the Wi-Fi name and password so the ESP 32 can connect to the network. 
00:32
Once connected, the ESP 32 reads its assigned IP address and displays it on the OLED screen, making it easy for users to access the.
00:42
Device through a browser using the web page editing library. 
00:45
A simple control web interface is created where real time sensor values such as temperature can be displayed along with their units. 
00:53
Each value is linked to a unique card ID to avoid conflicts between modules. 
00:59
Web buttons are then added to the page.
01:02
Each assigned a specific function, like controlling an LED's or other external devices with unique card labels to separate their usage. 
01:10
These buttons allow users to send commands to the ESP 32 remotely through the web interface. 
01:16
After uploading the code, the OLED shows the IP address of the ESP 32.
01:22
When a computer or mobile phone connected to the same Wi-Fi network enters this IP address in a browser, the control page opens, allowing users to monitor data and control devices wirelessly.
01:33
This project demonstrates how ESP 32 can act as a powerful IoT controller, enabling real time monitoring and remote control through Wi-Fi, which is widely used in smart homes, automation systems and connected devices.


In this project, we demonstrate a Wi-Fi real time display system using the ESP 32 to monitor multiple environmental sensor values on a web page.
00:16
The ESP 32 connects to a Wi-Fi network by initializing the Wi-Fi module with the network name and password, and once connected, it obtains an IP address which is displayed on the OLED screen for easy access.
00:29
At the same time, sensors such as the temperature and humidity sensor, pressure sensor using the BMP 388 module, photo resistor for light intensity, sound sensor, PIR motion sensor, and ultrasonic sensor are initialized and read continuously.
00:46
Each sensor value is updated in real time on a web page using dedicated web display blocks where every value is assigned a label and unit so it can be clearly identified.
00:57
The OLED serves as a local display to confirm successful Wi-Fi connection, while the web page allows remote monitoring.
01:04
After uploading the code, users connect their computer or mobile phone to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP 32 and enter the displayed IP address into a browser to view live sensor data.
01:15
If a mobile hotspot is used, the IP address can be accessed directly from the phone. 
01:22
This project highlights how ESP 32 can collect data from multiple sensors and publish it wirelessly in real time, making it highly useful for smart environment monitoring, IoT dashboards, and remote sensing applications.


In this Wi-Fi piano project, we use the ESP 32 to create a simple online musical instrument that can be played through a web page. 
00:15
First the Wi-Fi module and the OLED display are initialized and once the ESP 32.
00:20
Connect to the Wi-Fi network. 
00:22
Its IP address is shown on the OLED so the user knows where to access the piano controls. 
00:28
On the web page, 7 separate buttons are created and each button is assigned to specific musical tone. 
00:35
Do, re, me, FA, so la and C These buttons are linked to the speaker.
00:40
Through the program, so when any button is pressed on the web interface, the ESP 32 receives the command and immediately plays the corresponding tone through the speaker. 
00:50
Each button works independently, allowing users to press different notes in sequence to create simple melodies. 
00:56
After uploading the code, any computer or mobile phone connected to the.
01:01
Same Wi-Fi network can open a browser, enter the displayed IP address and view the piano control page where pressing the buttons produces sound in real time, clearly demonstrating how Wi-Fi communication can be used to control audio output remotely using the ESP 32.

In this project we demonstrate Wi-Fi based control of devices using the ESP 32, where an LED, a servo motor and a fan are controlled wirelessly through a web page.
00:17
1st, the Wi-Fi module and OLED display are initialized and after a successful connection, the ESP 32's IP address is shown on the OLED screen so the user can easily access the control page. 
00:29
For each device, a variable is created to store its current state, such as using a variable named rattle to represent whether the red.
00:37
LED is on or off on the web page. 
00:41
Individual buttons are added for controlling the red LED, yellow LED, green LED servo, and motor. 
00:47
When a button is pressed, the program checks the corresponding variable value using a condition block. 
00:53
If the value is 0, the device turns on and the variable is updated.
00:58
01 and if the value is already one, the device turns off and the variable is reset to 0. 
01:04
This toggle logic allows each button to switch the device state back and forth with every press. 
01:10
The same method is applied to control the servo movement and the fan motor. 
01:15
After uploading the code, the OLED displays the IP address.
01:18
And by connecting a computer or mobile phone to the same Wi-Fi network and entering the IP address in a browser, users can access the web interface and control all connected devices wirelessly, demonstrating a practical and easy to understand example of IoT based remote control using ESP 32.

In this video, we are going to learn how to create a voice controlled lighting system that automatically turns on an LED when it detects sound in a dark environment. 
00:16
This project combines a sound sensor, a photo resistor and an LED.
00:20
To simulate a smart lighting control system similar to hallway or staircase lighting that turns on only when needed. 
00:26
The photo resistor ensures that the LED does not turn on during daytime or when the light level is already bright, which helps save energy.
00:35
The sound sensor detects the volume of noise in the environment and compares it to a preset threshold. 
00:41
When the sound is loud enough, for example a clap or someone speaking, the LED switches on for a few seconds and then turns off automatically. 
00:50
Let us understand how the code is built. 
00:52
First we drag and place the basic setup.
00:55
Blocks for reading the photoresistor and controlling the LED's. 
00:58
Next we add an if condition block to check the photo resistor value.
01:04
If the analog value is lower than a threshold such as 500, meaning it is dark, the program continues to the next condition. 
01:12
Inside the zip block. 
01:13
We add another if condition to check the sound sensor reading.
01:17
If the sound value goes above 200, meaning a detectable sound is made, the LED turns on. 
01:23
Then we insert a delay of five seconds so the LED stays lit for a short duration before turning off. 
01:29
Once the code is ready and uploaded, we can test the system.
01:35
If you make loud sounds under normal lighting conditions, the LED will not turn on because the photo resistor detects brightness and blocks the signal. 
01:43
However, if you cover the photo resistor to simulate darkness and then clap or speak loudly, the LED lights up for five seconds and then turns off automatically. 
01:53
This project demonstrates an excellent example of combining.
01:56
Two sensors to create smart automation and energy saving behavior.
02:01
It can be applied in hallways, staircases, bedrooms, parking areas and other places.

In this project, we build an Ultrasonic Ranger by combining an ultrasonic sensor with an OLED display to create a simple and effective distance measuring device that can detect objects in the range of about four to 300 centimeters to begin.
00:20
We prepare the basic initialization blocks so the program runs continuously, and then we initialize the OLED module to enable text display. 
00:28
Next, we set the OLED text size to 12 by 16 so the information is clearly visible on the screen. 
00:36
After that we declare A variable named distance and assign it the value detected.
00:41
By the ultrasonic sensor allowing the system to constantly update the measured distance in real time before displaying new data, we clear any existing content on the OLED to avoid overlapping text.
00:54
Then we add display blocks to show the label distance on the first line of the OLED screen, followed by the actual distance value on the second line, and finally add the unit CM after the number so the reading is easy to understand. 
01:07
To make sure the displayed information updates properly, we include an OLED refresh block at the end of the loop.
01:14
Once the code is uploaded, the OLED screen immediately begins showing the distance detected by the ultrasonic sensor, updating continuously as objects move closer or farther away. 
01:24
This project demonstrates how ultrasonic sensors can be used for accurate distance measurement and how an OLED module can present sensor data, clearly making it a useful foundation.
01:35
For applications such as obstacle detection, parking assistants, robotics, and smart measuring tools.
        
In this smart control panel project, we use the ESP 32's built-in Wi-Fi feature to create an intelligent web-based control system that can both control devices and display sensor data wirelessly. 
00:18
First, the Wi-Fi module.
00:20
OLED display are initialized and once the ESP 32 connects to the Wi-Fi network, its IP address is shown on the OLED screen so the user can easily access the control panel. 
00:31
On the web page. 
00:32
Different display cards are created to show real time values from connected modules such as sensors, allowing users to monitor environmental.
00:40
Our system data remotely. 
00:41
Along with this, multiple web buttons are defined and each button is assigned to specific functions such as turning LED S on or off, controlling A servo motor, or operating other connected modules. 
00:54
When a button is pressed on the web interface, the ESP 32 receives the command instantly and performs the assigned.
01:01
Action demonstrating real time wireless control. 
01:03
After uploading the program, any mobile phone or computer connected to the same Wi-Fi network can open a browser, enter the displayed IP address and access the Smart Control panel where both device control and live data monitoring are combined into a single, easy to use interface.
01:21
Clearly showing how ESP 32 can be used to build practical IoT control systems.
      
In this project, we create a creative and informal RGB ring clock that uses an RGB LED ring to represent time through colors, where red indicates the hour, green shows the minute, and blue displays the seconds and because the ring.
00:20
12 LEDs. 
00:21
Each bead represents A5 second or five minute interval, making the clock simple yet visually appealing. 
00:27
We start the build by preparing the basic blocks, initializing the serial port at 9600 baud and setting up the RGB ring module. 
00:37
Then we declare 3 variables named our minute.
00:40
And 2nd assigning them initial values like 10/30/40. 
00:43
After this basic setup we create a custom function called clock code which handles the entire time counting logic. 
00:51
Inside this function we increment the second value every second and check if seconds reach 60. 
00:57
If they do we reset seconds to 0.
01:00
And increase the minute by 1. 
01:02
Similarly if minutes reach 60 we reset them and increase the hour, and if hours exceed 12 we roll them back to 1.
01:11
With this logical structure, the clock stays in the standard 12 hour format. 
01:15
We then add a one second delay to ensure real time counting and print the updated time values on the serial monitor for reference.
01:24
After the time tracking part, we start programming the RGB ring to display the time visually. 
01:29
For the seconds, we check whether 2nd modulo 5 = 0. 
01:33
If it is 0, the 12th bead lights up and for all other values we light the bead corresponding to 2nd slash 5 -, 1 with blue representing seconds.
01:44
The same idea is applied to minutes, but without the clear block condition, and green LED's represent the minutes. 
01:51
For the hours, we directly map the hour value to the bead number using hour one, since 1:00 to 12:00 corresponds neatly to beads 0 to 11 and these are displayed in red. 
02:02
Finally, after preparing all timing and.
02:04
LED mapping logic. 
02:05
We refresh the RGB ring so that the correct bead lights up for each unit of time. 
02:11
Once the code is uploaded and an initial time is entered, the RGB ring begins functioning like a colorful analog clock, with blue completing a full circle every minute, green showing minute progress, and red marking our positions.
02:25
When colors overlap, only one is visible depending on priority, maintaining clarity. 
02:30
Although this project doesn't use a real time clock chip, it still serves as an excellent demonstration of how to combine LED's variables arithmetic.
      
In this project, we learn how to control a servo motor using the X axis of a joystick, a method commonly used in real applications such as remotely opening or closing doors and switching mechanical devices on or off to build this.
00:20
Rogram We start with the basic initialization blocks, so the system runs continuously. 
00:24
Then we declare A variable named angle and assign it the X axis value read from the joystick, which changes depending on whether the joystick is moved left or right.
00:36
Inside the main loop, we use conditional logic to check the value of angle. 
00:41
When the joystick is pushed to the right, the X axis value becomes very high, typically greater than 3500, and under this condition the servo rotates to 0°. 
00:51
When the joystick is pushed to the left, the X axis value becomes.
00:56
Very low, usually less than 500, and in this case the servo rotates to 180°.
01:03
These two conditions allow the servo to respond directly to joystick movement, creating a simple and effective remote control system. 
01:10
After uploading the completed code, you can test the project by moving the joystick left and right. 
01:16
Pushing it to the left causes the servo to rotate to 180°, while pushing it to the right makes the servo.
01:24
Rotate back to 0°.
01:27
This project demonstrates how analog joystick input can be converted into precise mechanical motion, and it helps you understand the relationship between sensor readings, variables, conditional statements, and servo motor control, and practical automation and robotics applications.
         
Intrusion alarm is a security system designed to detect unauthorized entry into a protected area and alert people immediately. 
00:13
It is commonly used in homes, shops, warehouses, supermarkets, and many other places to ensure safety of people.
00:20
Property In this project, Air motion sensor is used to sense human movement. 
00:26
When the system is powered on, the sensor continuously monitors the surroundings.
00:33
If any motion is detected, the PIR sensor outputs a high value which activates the alarm system.
00:40
As a result, the speaker starts sounding an alert, the red LED turns on to indicate danger and the green LED turns off when there is no movement. 
00:49
The P IR sensor outputs a low value, the speaker remains silent, the red LED stays off, and the green LED turns on to show normal condition. 
00:59
This intrusion.
01:00
Alarm system provides a simple and effective way to monitor restricted areas and improve security.
          
In this project, we create a human body piano that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of your hand and place different musical notes based on how far your hand is from the sensor, turning your hand movements into a fun and interactive piano.
00:21
The system includes an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement, A variable named distance to store the detected value, and a speaker to play the tones.
00:30
To build the code manually, start with a when green flag clicked block and add a forever loop so the sensor continuously reads the distance.
00:39
Then assign the ultrasonic sensor value to the distance variable.
00:43
Next, use a series of IF conditions to check different distance ranges. 
00:48
If the distance is between 5 to 10 centimeters play due between 10 to 15 centimeters play RE, 15 to 20 centimeters play ME, 20 to 25 centimeters play FA, 25 to 30 centimeters play SO 30 to 35 centimeters play LA.
01:04
And 35 to 40 centimeters play C.
01:08
Duplicate the same structure for all 7 notes, adjusting the distance conditions accordingly. 
01:12
And finally add a block to stop the tone when your hand moves out of the note ranges.
01:18
Once uploaded, place your hand in front of the sensor and slowly move it closer or farther to play different tones.
01:25
The speaker responds instantly, allowing you to create melodies, experiment with rhythm, or slide your hand to produce a smooth musical scale.
01:34
This project helps you learn how ultrasonic sensors, variables, loops, and conditional statements work together, making it both educational and fun. 
01:42
It's a great example of how coding and music can combine to create an engaging STEM activity, and you can even extend it later by adding LED's or display screens to enhance the experience.
     
In this video tutorial, we will learn how to create a mini environment monitoring device that displays temperature, humidity, air pressure, and altitude using an OLED screen. 
00:16
We begin by building the two basic setup blocks and then initialize.
00:20
Built the BMP 388 sensor and the OLED display. 
00:24
Next we add a string block to set the required parameters. 
00:28
After that we read the BMP 388 sensor values and start displaying information on the OLED.
00:36
On the first line, we center the text data Suggs by setting the cursor to around X = 30. 
00:42
Then we set the display position starting from y = 10 and add 3 OLED display blocks. 
00:48
The first block shows T for temperature in mill warp mode, the next block displays the actual temperature value, and the third block shows the unit.
00:57
See in warp mode we duplicate this structure to display humidity where the first line shows our H.
01:04
The second line shows the humidity value and the third line displays the unit per cent. 
01:09
We repeat the same steps again for air pressure, using P on the first line, the pressure value on the second line, and the unit HPA on the third line. 
01:20
Finally, we duplicate once more for altitude, starting with ASL on the 1st.
01:25
The altitude value on the second line and the unit M on the third line.
01:30
To finish the project, we add an OLED refresh block and a one second delay so the values update smoothly. 
01:38
After uploading the complete code, the OLED display will continuously show real time temperature, humidity, air pressure and altitude, turning your setup into a compact environmental monitoring device.
     
In this project, we create a digital compass using the AK-8975 magnetic sensor and an OLED display to visually indicate direction with arrows. 
00:15
First, the program begins with the basic initialization blocks, so the system.
00:20
Runs continuously. 
00:21
We then initialize both the AKA 8975 Compass module and the OLED display and declare A variable named direction to store the heading value measured by the sensor inside the loop. 
00:33
The OLED screen is cleared to ensure a clean display and the direction value read from the AK-8975.
00:40
Module is assigned to the direction variable based on this value. 
00:45
Conditional blocks are used to determine which arrows should be displayed on the OLED. 
00:51
When the direction value is between 3:40 and 360°, an upward arrow is shown indicating N if the direction falls between 230.
01:00
And 250°, a right arrow appears representing E When the direction value is between 1:40 and 170°, a downward arrow is displayed indicating South and if the direction is between 70 and 90°, a left arrow appears representing W after selecting the.
01:21
Direct Arrow, An OLED refresh block updates the display and a short delay of half a second is added to ensure smooth and stable readings.
01:30
Once the code is uploaded, the OLED arrow initially points close to the self direction and as the coding box is rotated, the arrow changes accordingly, clearly showing real time directional movement. 
01:41
This project demonstrates how a magnetic sensor can be used for compass applications and how sensor data can be converted into intuitive visual indicators.
01:50
Making it useful for navigation systems, robotics and orientation based projects. 
      
In this project we create a mini car backing radar that works just like the reversing sensors used in real vehicles, using an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance behind the car, a traffic light LED module for visual alerts and a speaker.
00:20
For sound warnings.
00:22
We begin by building the basic coding blocks and then declare A variable named distance which stores the value detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
00:31
The program continuously updates this value so the system always knows how far the obstacle is. 
00:37
Next, we add a condition to check if the distance is greater than 40 centimeters. 
00:42
If it is, the system shows a safe situation by turning on the green LED's, keeping the red LED off, and making sure the speaker stays silent.
00:51
Then we add another condition for when the distance is less than 40 centimeters.
00:57
In this case, the system recognizes danger, so the red LED turns on, the green LED turns off, and the speaker starts beeping to warn that an obstacle is too close. 
01:08
After uploading the program, testing becomes very simple. 
01:10
When the sensor detects a larger safe distance, only the green light glows and no sound is produced.
01:17
But when something approaches too closely, the warning light and alarm activate immediately.
01:23
This project clearly demonstrates how ultrasonic sensing, conditional logic and output modules work together to create a real world safety device. 
01:31
It shows how the ultrasonic sensor acts like the eyes, constantly checking for objects, while the LED's and speaker act like the signals and voice that guide the user.
01:43
Even though this is a small scale model, it works on the same principle used in modern cars to avoid collisions while reversing, making it an excellent beginner friendly example of applying sensors and programming to solve real problems effectively.
          
In this project we create a button controlled fan system where the fan turns on or off depending on which button is pressed, using an add key input to read different analog values from each button. 
00:17
To build the code manually, we start with the basic setup.
00:21
Blocks the when green flag clicked block and a forever loop, so the fan continuously responds to button presses. 
00:27
Next we create a variable named item and inside the loop we assign the analog value from the AD key sensor to this variable.
00:37
The AD key module gives different analog readings for different buttons. 
00:40
So we use an if else condition to read these values and decide what the fan should do if the value of item is greater than 3500, which corresponds to pressing the red button. 
00:52
We stop the fan by setting both motor pins low if the value is between 2030.
00:58
Which corresponds to pressing the yellow button. 
01:00
We activate the fan by making the motor rotate.
01:04
These conditions allow the system to instantly react to whichever button the user presses. 
01:09
After deciding the fan state. 
01:11
We add a short delay of around 0.3 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in readings and make the button response smooth once uploaded to the board, Pressing the yellow button makes the fan spin and pressing the red button.
01:24
Turns it off, showing how simple button inputs can be used to control real hardware.
01:30
This activity teaches how analog key modules work, how to read sensor values, and how conditions and motor control instructions together can create an efficient interactive device. 
01:40
It's a fun introduction to digital input control and a practical demonstration of using buttons to manage electrical appliances in a safe and programmable way.
           
In this video tutorial, we will learn how to create an automatic fan system that works using both temperature sensing and motion detection to save energy.
00:15
During hot summer days, many public places use auto fans that turn on only when the surrounding temperature becomes too high. 
00:21
In this project, we will enhance that idea by adding a PIR motion sensor so the fan will run only when the temperature crosses the threshold and a person is detected nearby.
00:33
1st we create the basic setup blocks and then we declare A variable named temp. 
00:38
Next we read the temperature sensor value and assign it to the temp variable so the program can continuously check the environment.
00:46
Then we add an if else block to compare the temperature value with the set limit such as 28°.
00:52
If the value is higher, the program proceeds to the next condition. 
00:56
If not, the fan remains off. 
00:58
After that we add another if else block to read the P IR sensor.
01:04
If the par value is 1, meaning motion is detected, the fan turns on.
01:09
Otherwise it remains off after uploading the complete test code. 
01:14
The system works automatically whenever the temperature rises above 28° and the PIR sensor detects someone the fan starts were tating.
01:23
If either condition is not met, temperature too low, or no motion detected, the fan stays off, ensuring efficient and smart energy usage.
           
In this activity, we create an automatic door system similar to those found in malls, where the door opens when a person approaches and closes when no one is near by. 
00:16
To build this program, we start with the basic initialization blocks.
00:20
Using the green flag and a forever loop to make sure the system keeps checking for movement.
00:25
Inside the loop we add a condition block to read the output of the PIR motion sensor.
00:31
This sensor detects infrared radiation from human bodies, and it outputs one when someone is present and 0 when the area is clear. 
00:40
Based on this reading, we control a servo motor that represents the door. 
00:45
When the PR sensor detects motion, the servo rotates to 180°, which simulates the door opening.
00:52
When no motion is detected, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door.
00:58
By continuously evaluating the sensor values, the door responds automatically to people approaching and leaving.
01:05
After uploading the code, simply wave your hand in front of the PIR sensor and the servo turns to 180°, opening the door. 
01:13
As soon as the center no longer detects movement, the servo slowly returns.
              
In this project we create a simple access control system using an RFID module, a magnetic or IC card and a servo motor to simulate a real access door.
00:17
The idea is that when the correct card is scanned, the door opens automatically and if the card is not recognized, the door stays locked.
00:25
To build the program, we begin with the basic start and forever blocks, so the system constantly checks for a card.
00:32
We initialize the RFID module so it can read card data, and then we create a string variable called ID card that stores the correct card code. 
00:40
Each user will have a different code, so you must replace the sample code with the one read from your own card. 
00:47
Inside the forever loop, we use a condition that compares the scanned RFID code with the stored.
00:53
ID card value.
00:55
If the scanned code matches, it means the card is authorized and the servo rotates to 180° representing the door opening.
01:04
The servo holds this position for three seconds to allow the person to enter. 
01:08
After the delay, the servo returns to 0°, closing the door again. 
01:13
If the scant card does not match the stored code, the condition fails and the servo remains at 0°, indicating that the door is locked and access is denied.
01:24
After uploading the program, simply place your card near the RFID sensor. 
01:28
If it is the correct card, the servo will smoothly rotate to open the door and then return to the closed position.
01:36
If the card is incorrect, nothing happens demonstrating reliable and secure access control.
01:42
This experiment clearly shows how RFID technology, variables and conditional logic can work together to build real world security systems similar to those used in offices, apartments and commercial buildings.
    
In this video tutorial, we are going to learn how to build an automatic window closing system that reacts to changes in light. 
00:13
This project uses a photo resistor as a light sensor and a servo motor to open and close the window.
00:20
The idea behind the project is simple. 
00:23
When the surrounding environment becomes dark, the system should automatically close the window for safety and energy efficiency. 
00:29
The photo resistor plays a key role in detecting light intensity because its resistance changes according to the ambient light level. 
00:37
We set a threshold value that determines when the window.
00:41
Would close if the analog value of the photo resistor drops below this threshold, meaning the environment is dark, the servo rotates to 180°, simulating the closing of the window. 
00:53
Otherwise, when the value is higher than the threshold indicating daylight or sufficient brightness, the servo returns to 0°.
01:01
Opening the window now, let's discuss the block coding process. 
01:05
We begin by placing the basic initialization blocks for reading the photo resistor and controlling the servo motor. 
01:12
Then we insert an IF condition block to compare the analog input value. 
01:17
Inside the if section, we add the servo control block and set the rotation.
01:22
The 180° for the dark condition. 
01:24
In the L section, we again add the servo block and set its rotation to 0° for the bright condition. 
01:31
After completing the code and uploading it, we can test the system by covering the photo resistor with our hand or any object. 
01:39
When the light decreases, the threshold is crossed.
01:42
And the servo rotates to 180°, closing the window. 
01:46
When the cover is removed and the analog value becomes higher than the threshold, the servo moves back to 0°, opening the window again. 
01:55
This automatic window system demonstrates an excellent real world application of sensors and actuators, showing how automation can improve.
02:03
Everyday life.
         
Sound Sensor Overview The sound sensor contains a high sensitivity microphone and an LM358 operational amplifier. 
00:14
The microphone captures weak sound signals. 
00:17
These signals are then amplified by the.
00:20
LM358 so the output becomes clear and easy to detect. 
00:25
Because of its high sensitivity and fast response, this sensor is widely used in sound detection and recognition tasks. 
00:34
It provides a stable and reliable sound input for many intelligent devices.
00:40
Code blocks One board rate block. 
00:43
This block sets the board rate. 
00:46
Common values are 9600 or 115,200. 
00:50
In this project, the board rate is set to 9602. 
00:55
Print block. 
00:56
This block prints information on the serial monitor.
01:00
It supports 3 modes, warp, no warp and hexadecimal warp is the default printing mode 3 sound reading block. 
01:08
This block reads the analog value of the sound detected by the sensor manually building the blocks. 
01:16
Follow the images and assemble the blocks in the correct order.
01:21
Step one. 
01:22
Open the coding software, go to File and select Load from your computer. 
01:27
Choose the file you previously downloaded if needed or start with a new file. 
01:33
Step 2. 
01:34
Add the block when Arduino begin. 
01:36
Step three from the serial category, drag the block Serial 0.
01:41
Again baudrate 9600. 
01:43
Place it under the Arduino Begin block. 
01:46
Step 4 Add a forever block from the control section. 
01:50
Step 5 Inside the forever block placed the serial print block. 
01:55
It should appear as serial zero Print Hello kids block warp. 
02:00
This text will later.
02:01
Be replaced by the sound value. 
02:04
Step 6 From the sound category, drag the block that reads the value of sound. 
02:09
Place it inside the print block where the text content normally goes. 
02:14
It should now look like serial zero print. 
02:17
Read the value of sound IO34 warp complete. 
02:20
Test code the complete.
02:22
Mark structure should be when Arduino begins serial zero, begin baudrate 9600 forever Serial zero print. 
02:29
Read the value of sound IO34 warp test results. 
02:34
Upload the code to the board. 
02:37
Open the serial monitor. 
02:39
Set the board rate to 9600.
02:42
Before starting, you will see a continuous stream of numbers. 
02:46
These numbers represent the analog sound values detected by the sensor.
        
In this video tutorial we will learn about the 9 gram servo motor, its working principle, wiring and how to control it using block coding. 
00:16
A9 gram servo is a small but powerful motor used in robotics.
00:20
Projects for its high precision and good torque. 
00:24
It can rotate up to 180° and operates with low noise. 
00:28
The servo has three wires. 
00:30
The brown wire is G&D connected to ground. 
00:34
The red wire is VCC connected to five volts or 3.3 volts power supply and the orange.
00:41
Wire is the signal pin which receives PWM pulse width modulation signals to control the rotation angle. 
00:48
The servo angle is determined by the pulse width, where one millisecond rotates the servo to 0° and two milliseconds rotates it to 180°. 
00:58
Now let us move to coating first place.
01:01
Servo control block and set the degree to zero and delay to two seconds. 
01:07
Duplicate the block and change the angle to 90° and again duplicate to change the angle to 180°. 
01:14
Finally duplicate once more to bring the servo back to 0. 
01:18
After uploading the servo will rotate to zero 90 and 180°.
01:22
Each staying for two seconds and then repeat. 
01:26
For the extension activity, we gradually rotate the servo from zero to 180 using a repeat block set to 180. 
01:34
Then place the servo angle block inside and increase the degree step by step with a delay of 10 milliseconds.
01:43
Duplicate this block and change the increase to decrease to move the servo back from 180 to 0. 
01:51
When the code is uploaded, the servo will smoothly rotate forward and backward continuously. 
01:57
Servo motors are widely used in robotic arms, grippers, steering mechanisms, aircraft models, and many mechanical.
02:04
Systems.
         
388 Pressure sensor is a neumatic MEMS sensor designed in a compact package with small size, low power consumption and high performance. 
00:17
It combines both temperature and pressure.
00:22
Portable and mobile applications.
00:25
This module adopts proven piezo resistive pressure sensing technology which provides high accuracy, good linearity, long term stability and excellent electromagnetic interference resistance. 
00:39
It offers great flexibility when working with multiple devices and.
00:45
Is widely used.
00:49
Wearable devices, smart home systems, and other consumer electronics. 
00:54
It can be optimized further to improve power consumption, resolution and filtering performance based on piezoelectric pressure sensing technology, the BMP 380.
01:08
8 measures air pressure and temperature accurately. 
01:12
It can measure pressure ranging from 300 to 1250 hectopascals while consuming very low power only 3.4 micro amperes at A1 Hertz operating frequency. 
01:26
The built in.
01:28
Infinite Impulse response filter helps reduce external interference effects and ensures smooth readings. 
01:35
Now let us build the test code manually. 
01:40
First, drag the block to initialize the BMP 388 pressure sensor. 
01:45
Without this block the module.
01:48
Will not operate. 
01:50
Next, use the block that reads the BMP 388 sensor values so that pressure, altitude and temperature data can be collected. 
02:00
Then go to the serial section and find the block to begin board rate. 
02:07
Set the baud rate.
02:09
To 9600 and place this block under the start block. 
02:13
Now add a forever loop and inside it add a print block. 
02:17
Set it to print pressure in no warp mode and place the read pressure data after it.
02:25
Duplicate the print block to display altitude and modify it to show altitude values. 
02:31
Duplicate again and set it to rint temperature and modify it to show the temperature value in degrees Celsius. 
02:39
Finally change the last print block to war mode so the output appears clearly line by line.
02:47
Add a delay of one second so the readings can be observed smoothly. 
02:52
Upload the code and open the serial monitor. 
02:55
You will now see the real time values detected by the BMP 388 sensor.
03:03
The pressure, altitude and temperature readings will continuously update based on environmental changes when pressured.
    
PIR motion sensor. 
00:07
The PIR motion sensor uses the RE-200 BP sensing element. 
00:12
It works based on the pyroelectric effect, which means it can detect infrared radiation naturally released.
00:20
By a human body or an animal, with the help of a Fresnel lens, the sensor can detect motion from a greater distance and over a wider area. 
00:30
When a person or an animal moves within its sensing range, the PIR sensor outputs a high signal. 
00:37
When no motion is present, it outputs a low signal.
00:41
The programming blocks shown demonstrate how to read the PIR sensor value and use it inside an IF and else structure. 
00:49
The code checks whether motion is detected. 
00:51
If the condition is true, the instructions inside the IF section will run. 
00:56
If the condition is false, the code inside the L section will run.
01:02
To test the PIR sensor code, you can either load the prepared file directly from your computer or manually build the blocks yourself. 
01:10
After opening the software, you choose the option to load from your computer. 
01:15
Once the file is opened, the code appears in the workspace when building the blocks manually.
01:22
To start with the block that runs when Arduino begins. 
01:25
You then add the serial block and set the board rate as needed. 
01:30
Inside a forever loop you insert an if and else block. 
01:34
The goal is to continuously check the PIR sensor reading. 
01:38
From the PIR category you select the block that reads.
01:42
The PIR motion sensor value from the chosen interface pin. 
01:46
This block is then placed inside the condition area of the IF structure. 
01:51
If motion is detected, you can program the system to send a message through the serial monitor, such as printing the words someone. 
01:59
If no motion is detected the code.
02:02
Inside the else portion will run instead printing the message no one. 
02:06
Now let us understand how to complete the test code for the PIR motion sensor. 
02:12
After adding the print some one block under the if section, we also need to add the print no one block under the L section. 
02:21
This ensures that the system responds correctly.
02:24
Based on whether motion is detected or not, once both blocks are placed in the correct positions, the program becomes complete. 
02:32
The forever loop continuously checks for movement. 
02:35
If motion is detected by the PIR sensor, the system prints the word someone in the serial monitor.
02:44
If no movement is detected, the system prints the message No one. 
02:48
This completed code allows us to clearly observe how the PIR sensor responds in real time. 
02:54
When we upload the code to Arduino and open the serial monitor, we can see the live output as a person moves in front of the.
03:04
Sensor the serial monitor prints someone. 
03:06
When no motion is detected, the serial monitor prints no one. 
03:11
This helps verify that the sensor and the code are working correctly.

Photo resistor is a photoelectric device that operates according to the principle of semiconductor photoconductivity. 
00:12
It can sense the brightness of the surrounding environment and convert it into an analog value that.
00:20
Changes based on light intensity. 
00:22
In this activity, we will learn how to read the analog value of the photoresistor using Kids Block. 
00:29
First, open the code file by clicking the file button and selecting Load from your computer or open the downloaded code from your desktop. 
00:38
You can also build the program.
00:40
Manually begin by dragging the when Arduino begin block. 
00:44
Then go to the serial category and choose the begin board rate block and set it to 9600 and place it under the begin block. 
00:53
Next go to control and drag the forever block. 
00:57
Then return to cereal and drag the print block.
01:00
And place it inside the forever loop. 
01:03
Now go to the light category and select the read the value of light block and insert it into the print block so that the sensor value will be displayed. 
01:13
Add a wait half second block below it to clearly observe changes. 
01:18
Upload the code to the board after uploading.
01:21
Open the serial monitor. 
01:22
You will now see the analog values of the photoresistor changing continuously. 
01:27
When you cover the sensor with your hand, the value drops. 
01:31
When you shine more light, the value rises. 
01:35
This confirms that the photo resistor is working correctly and can detect real time changes in brightness.
     
Hello so today we will learn how project 21 sound controlled LED works by explaining the code block step by step followed by wiring and output. 
00:16
First take the when Arduino begin block.
00:20
This block runs only once when the board is powered on. 
00:24
Inside this block, take the Set Pin IO 25 mode output block. 
00:29
This tells the Arduino that the LED connected to pin IO25 will be used as an output device. 
00:36
Next, take the forever block. 
00:38
This block keeps the program running continuously.
00:42
Inside the forever block, take the IF else block. 
00:45
In the condition section, place the block read the value of sound IO 33 greater than 100. 
00:51
This block checks whether the sound sensor is detecting a loud sound greater than the set threshold value. 
00:57
Inside the if part, take the LED pin IO 25 out high block.
01:03
This turns the LED on when a loud sound is detected. 
01:07
After that at a wait 2 seconds block. 
01:10
So the LED stays on for a short time. 
01:13
Inside the else part, take the LED pin IO 25 out low block. 
01:17
This turns the LED off when the sound level is low. 
01:21
Now let's understand the wiring.
01:24
Connect the sound sensor signal pin to IO33 on the board and connect its VCC and GND properly. 
01:30
Connect the LED to pin IO25 and G&D so it can be controlled by the Arduino. 
01:36
Finally, the output. 
01:38
When the board is powered, the LED stays off in silence when you clap or make a loud sound.
01:45
With the sensor, the sound value crosses the threshold and the LED turns on when the sound stops the LED.
       
Hello everyone, in this video we are going to create project 20 light pillar where a dot matrix display is automatically controlled using a photo resistor and an Arduino ESP 32 board.
00:20
We begin by opening the Wiz Robo application, creating a new project, and selecting the Wiz Inventor Kit as the board. 
00:27
Once the programming interface opens, we move to the coding section and start with the One Arduino Begin block. 
00:34
In this block we initialize the dot matrix displayed by setting the DIN pin to IO23.
00:40
The CLK pin to IO 18 and the CS pin to IO 15. 
00:45
We also declare a global integer variable named light and set its initial value to 0. 
00:50
Next, we use the forever loop to continuously read the surrounding light level. 
00:55
The photoresistor connected to analog pin IO 33 is red and mapped from a range of.
01:01
Zero to 4095 into zero to seven, which represents the height of the light pillar on the dot matrix. 
01:08
Before drawing, the display is cleared by filling it with black. 
01:12
Then vertical red lines are drawn on the matrix using the mapped light value, forming a light pillar whose height changes in real time for the.
01:21
Hiring The photo resistor is connected to power ground and analog pin IO 33, allowing the ESP 32 to detect changes in light intensity. 
01:31
The dot matrix display is connected using the specified BIN, CLK and CSS pins.
01:38
As the light around the photo resistor changes, its resistance varies, causing the displayed light pillar to grow taller in bright conditions and shorter and darker conditions, demonstrating automatic light based control of the display.
     
Hello everyone, in this video we are going to create Project 19 dimming lamp where we control the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer and an Arduino ESP 32 board to begin.
00:20
We open the Wiz Robo application and create a new project, then select the board as the Wise Inventor Kit. 
00:26
Once the board is selected, the programming interface opens and we move to the coding section.
00:32
We start by using the one Arduino begin block, which runs once when the board is powered on. 
00:39
Inside this block we declare a global variable named pot and set its initial value to 0. 
00:45
Next we add a forever loop to continuously read the potentiometer value. 
00:49
Inside this loop, the variable pod is set using the map.
00:53
Block which reads the analog value from pin IO 33 and maps it from a range of 0 to 4095 into 0 to 255. 
01:02
This mapped value is then used in the analog write block to control the brightness of an LED connected to pin IO25, allowing the LED brightness to change smoothly as the potentiometer.
01:13
Was turned for the wiring. 
01:15
The potentiometer has three pins. 
01:17
1 outer pin is connected to three volts, the other outer pin is connected to ground and the middle pin is connected to the analog pin IO 33. 
01:27
The LED is connected with its positive terminal to IO25 and its negative terminal to ground.
01:33
Enabling the ESP 32 to control the LED using a PWM signal. 
01:38
The potentiometer works by changing its resistance, which alters the voltage across it. 
01:44
The ESP 32 reads this voltage as a value between 0 and 4095, then converts it into a value between 0 and 200.
01:53
55 to adjust the LED brightness after completing the wiring and uploading the program to the board, rotating the potentiometer changes the LED brightness smoothly from dim to bright, confirming that the dimming lamp project is working successfully.
        
Hello in this video we are going to create a project named Beating heart which is project 18 and in this project we will display a beating heart animation using an Arduino board and an 8 by 8 matrix display. 
00:19
Let us start.
00:20
By opening the Wiz Robo application. 
00:22
Now create a new project and select the board as was Inventor Kit. 
00:27
After selecting the board, the programming interface opens and we move to the coding section. 
00:32
First we use the block when Arduino begin which runs once when the board is powered on inside this block.
00:40
We initialized the matrix displayed by setting the DIN pin to IO23, CLK pin to IO 18, and CS pin to IO15, and then we set the brightness level so the display is clearly visible. 
00:53
Next we move to the forever loop, which runs continuously. 
00:57
Inside this loop we first clear the matrix.
01:00
Display by filling it with black color. 
01:03
After that we draw a heart shape using multiple draw line blocks with red color. 
01:08
Then we use the refresh display block so the heart appears on the dot matrix. 
01:13
We add a weight of one second to control the beating speed. 
01:17
After the delay, we again clear the display and draw a slightly larger.
01:21
Art pattern using draw line blocks creating the beating effect. 
01:25
Once again we refresh the display and add a one second delay. 
01:29
These steps repeat continuously making the heart look like it is beating. 
01:34
Now let us move to the wiring diagram. 
01:37
The dot matrix display is connected to the board using DIN.
01:41
CLK and CS pins along with power and ground. 
01:45
After completing the wiring, we upload the program to the board. 
01:49
Once uploaded, the dot matrix shows a red beating heart, confirming that the project is working successfully. 
01:56
Thank you for watching.
         
Hello in this video we are going to create a project named Invasion alarm which is project 17 and this project helps us detect unwanted movement in a particular area and alert the user instantly. 
00:17
Let us start by opening the Wiz Robo application.
00:21
On the screen now we click on Create New Project and select the board. 
00:26
Here we choose the board as was Inventor Kit. 
00:30
After selecting the board, the programming interface opens.
00:34
Now we move to the coding section. 
00:36
First we drag the block when Arduino begin, which runs once when the board is powered on. 
00:42
Inside this block we add the serial begin block and set the baud rate to 9600 so that the Arduino can communicate with the serial monitor properly. 
00:52
This step is important for viewing.
00:54
Output messages during testing. 
00:55
Next we add the forever loop which keeps running continuously. 
00:59
Inside the forever loop, we place an if else condition to check the PIR motion sensor. 
01:06
Here we use the read interface block, select IO5 as the pin and choose PIR motion sensor as the input device.
01:15
Now if motion is detected, the condition becomes true and the Arduino prints the message someone invaded on the serial monitor and also activates the LED and buzzer to give visual and sound alerts. 
01:27
If motion is not detected, the condition becomes false and the Arduino prints no one on the serial monitor indicating the area is safe.
01:36
We also add a weight of one second to keep the output stable and readable. 
01:41
Now let us move to the wiring diagram. 
01:43
The air sensor VCC is connected to five volts, G&D to ground and the out pin to IO5. 
01:49
The LED is connected with a resistor to a digital output pin and ground, and the buzzer is connected to another digital.
01:57
Output pin and ground. 
01:58
After completing the wiring we upload the program. 
02:01
Now we open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. 
02:06
When there is no movement it shows no one and when motion is detected it shows someone invaded confirming the invasion. 
02:14
Alarm system is working successfully.
         
Hello so today we will learn how project 16 time bomb works by understanding the code, wiring and output. 
00:13
In the code when the Arduino starts all button pins are set as input and the buzzer pin is set as output.
00:21
The dot matrix display is initialized using the DIN and CLK pins. 
00:26
Its brightness is adjusted, and a global variable is declared to store the countdown time inside the loop. 
00:33
The matrix display is continuously cleared and refreshed.
00:37
Pressing the increase button raises the timer value while the decrease button lowers it and the updated value is shown on the TM1650 digital tube display. 
00:46
When the start button is pressed, the countdown begins and the value decreases step by step. 
00:52
During this process, the dot matrix shows ball related symbols and the buzzer.
00:56
Turns on and off with delays to give warning beeps.
01:00
If the timer reaches 0, the buzzer sounds an alarm and the matrix displays an explosion style image.
01:06
A reset button allows the system to stop the alarm and return the timer to 0, and the code also ensures the value does not exceed its limit for wiring. 
01:16
All buttons are connected to their respective interface pins on the board with common power and ground. 
01:22
The dot matrix display is connected using its DIN and CLK pins along with VCC.
01:27
G and the TM1650 digital tube display is connected through its data and clock lines to show the countdown clearly. 
01:34
The buzzer is connected to a digital output pin and ground so it can be controlled directly by the program as the output. 
01:42
When the board is powered, the digital tube shows the set time.
01:47
Ressing the buttons increases or decreases the value. 
01:50
Once the countdown starts, the numbers reduce smoothly. 
01:54
The dot matrix displays animated bomb expressions and the.
        
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor KITIN this project we are working with a programmable responder system. 
00:12
This system is used in quiz competitions and classrooms where students press buttons to answer questions. 
00:17
The system checks the responses using LED's.
00:20
And helps improve students reaction time and attention. 
00:23
Now let us understand how the program works. 
00:26
We are simply understanding the logic behind the program. 
00:29
First, several pins are configured. 
00:30
The following pins are set as input.
00:34
IO16IO17IO18IO19 These pins are connected to the buttons. 
00:38
The following pins are set as output. 
00:41
IO12IO13IO14 IO 27. 
00:43
These pins are connected to the LED's that indicate the response result. 
00:48
Then a global variable named item is created and initialized with the value 0.
00:55
This variable is used as a control flag for the system. 
00:59
Now the program enters the forever loop, which keeps running continuously. 
01:03
First, the LED on IO27 is turned on. 
01:06
This LED indicates that the system is ready to receive responses.
01:12
Now the program checks if the button connected to ion 19 is pressed. 
01:17
The system starts the response round. 
01:20
Once the round starts, all LEDs IO12IO13IO14 IO 27 are turned off. 
01:24
To clear any previous result dot. 
01:27
A short delay of 0.2 seconds is given.
01:31
Now the program enters a loop that continues until item becomes one dot. 
01:35
This means the system will keep waiting until a valid response is received. 
01:39
Inside this waiting loop, the program monitors three buttons.
01:43
If the button on IO18IS pressed, the LED on IO12 turns on and item is set to 1 dot. 
01:49
If the button on IO17 is pressed, the LED on IO13 turns on, an item is set to 1 dot. 
01:54
If the button on iOS 16 is pressed, the LED on IO14 turns on and item is set to 1 dot. 
02:01
After uploading the code as soon as any one of these.
02:04
Buttons as pressed, the value of item becomes one and the system stops checking further buttons. 
02:09
This ensures that only the first response is accepted, just like in a real quiz competition.
    
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:07
This is the extended version of the Mini Lamp project. 
00:10
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:13
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port. 
00:18
Once the kit is connected we can start.
00:20
Loading this project, we will control a lamp using a button. 
00:24
When the button is pressed, the lamp will turn on. 
00:27
When the button is released, the lamp will turn off. 
00:30
Now let us build the program step by step. 
00:33
First go to the event section and drag when Arduino began. 
00:36
Next go to the pin section and set IO4AS output for the lamp.
00:40
LED IO15 as input for the button. 
00:43
Now go to the control section and add the forever block. 
00:46
Inside the forever block add an if else statement for the condition choose interface IO15 button will be pushed.
00:53
If this condition is true, it means the button is pressed besso inside the if part addled pin IO4 out hi GH. 
01:00
This turns the lamp on to I and the else part addled pin IO4 out LW. 
01:05
This turns the lamp off when the button is not pressed. 
01:08
Now upload the program to the Wiz inventor kit. 
01:11
After uploading press the button, the lamp turns on.
01:14
Release the button, the lamp turns off. 
01:16
So in this extended version of the Mini Lamp project, we learned how to use conditional logic to control a device using a button. 
01:22
Thank you for watching.
      
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:08
This is project 14 counter. 
00:10
In this project we have already written the program and now we are simply going to understand how the code works this counter.
00:20
And count from zero to 9999 using three buttons. 
00:23
1 button is used to increase the number, one is used to decrease the number and one is used to reset the counter. 
00:32
The value is shown on a 4 digit digital display. 
00:36
Let us understand the logic of the program.
00:40
First 3 pins are configured as input IO17IO18 and IO19. 
00:45
These are connected to the three buttons. 
00:48
Then a global variable named item is created. 
00:51
This variable stores the current number that we see on the display. 
00:57
Now the program enters the forever loop.
01:00
Which keeps running continuously. 
01:02
Inside this loop, the program checks each button. 
01:05
If the button on IO19 is pressed, the value of item increases by one. 
01:11
If the button on IO18IS pressed, the value of item decreases by 1.
01:17
If the button on IO17 is pressed, the value of item is reset to 0. 
01:23
After this the program checks one important condition. 
01:26
If the value becomes greater than 9999, it is automatically set back to 0. 
01:32
This keeps the number within the range of the four digit display finally.
01:37
The updated value of item is sent to the display using the TM1650 display block and a small delay of 0.2 seconds is added so that the counting remains smooth and readable.
01:51
So the program continuously listens to the buttons, updates the number and refreshes the display. 
01:56
This is how the counter works.
01:59
Now upload the program to the Wise Inventor Kit.
02:03
After uploading, press IO19 button, the number increases, ress IO18 button, the number decreases, press IO17 button, the counter resets. 
02:11
The display always stays between 0 and 9999. 
02:14
So in this project we learned how to create a multifunction digital counter using buttons, variables and display control.
         
Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:07
This is Project 13 Mini lamp. 
00:09
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:12
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port. 
00:17
Once the kit is connected we can start coding.
00:20
I end this project. 
00:21
We will control a lamp using a button and observe the button status using the serial monitor. 
00:27
Now let us understand the working principle. 
00:29
When the button is not pressed, voltage from VCC passes through a resistor and provides a high signal to the input pin. 
00:36
When the button is pressed, the pin is connected to G&D producing.
00:40
Low signal the resistor prevents a short circuit between VCC and GND. 
00:44
Now let us build the program. 
00:46
First go to the events section and drag when Arduino begin. 
00:50
Then go to the serial section and add serial zero. 
00:53
Begin baudrate 9600. 
00:54
Next go to the pin section and add set pin IO15 mode input. 
00:58
Now go to the control section.
01:00
And add the forever block. 
01:02
Inside the forever loop go to the serial section and drag serial zero print key status in no wrap mode. 
01:08
Then add another serial block and choose Print the state value of button in interface IO15 in wrap mode. 
01:14
Now upload the program to the Wiz Inventor kit. 
01:17
After uploading open the serial monitor and set the baud rate.
01:21
The 96-O dot when you press the button, the serial monitor will display key status 0. 
01:26
When you release the button, it will display key status once. 
01:29
So in this project we learned how to read a button input, understand its logic level.
01:35
And display the result using serial communication. 
01:38
Thank you for watching.

00:23
Data servo motor is a high precision motor that can rotate up to 180°. 
00:29
It is lightweight, fast, stable and commonly used in robots, automatic doors and smart devices. 
00:34
Now let us understand the working principle. 
00:37
Data servo motor has three wires brown for.
00:40
DND read for VCC 3 point 3V or 5V orange for the signal pin. 
00:45
The rotation angle of the servo is controlled using PWM signals. 
00:48
To be why changing the pulse width of the signal, we control the servo angle from 0° to 180°. 
00:55
Now let us build the program. 
00:57
First go to the events section and drag when Arduino begin.
01:01
Next, go to the Variables section and create a global variable. 
01:04
Set its type to int, name it angle and assign its initial value to 0 dot. 
01:09
Now go to the control section and add the forever block. 
01:13
Inside the forever loop, drag a Repeat 180 times block. 
01:16
Inside this block add Change angle by plus plus. 
01:19
Then go to the servo section.
01:21
Drag servo pin IO 4 channel Ch 0° variable angle delay 15. 
01:27
This rotates the servo smoothly from 0° to 180°. 
01:31
Next at another repeat 180 times block inside it add change angle by again place the servo pin IO 4 channel CH-0.
01:42
Degree Variable Angle delay 15 block. 
01:44

00:25
In this project we will create an O distress signal device. 
00:30
An SOS device is used in emergency situations to send a help signal.
00:36
This signal follows Morse code where the letter S is represented by three short blinks and the letter O is represented by three long blinks. 
00:44
Now let us build the program step by step. 
00:47
First go to the events section and drag the block when Arduino begin. 
00:52
Next go to the pin section and drag set pin IO5 mode.
00:56
Output. 
00:56
This prepares the LED connected to IO5 to work as an output. 
01:01
Now go to the control section and add a forever block. 
01:06
This allows the SOS signal to repeat continuously.
01:10
Inside the forever loop, we create the signal, drag a repeat three times block inside it, place LED pin IO5 out high, then add weight 0.15 seconds, then LED pin IO5 out low, then weight 0.1 seconds. 
01:27
This creates 3 quick blinks which represent.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the Wiz Inventor Kit. 
00:08
This is Project 2 Breathing LED. 
00:10
First open the Wiz Robo app on your computer. 
00:13
Now connect the Wiz Inventor kit using a USB cable and select the correct COM port once the kit is connected.
00:20
We can start coding. 
00:21
In this project, we will create a breathing LED effect. 
00:25
A breathing LED is an LED whose brightness slowly increases and decreases just like breathing. 
00:30
This effect is created using PWM. 
00:33
Now let us understand what PWM is.
00:37
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. 
00:39
PWM allows us to control analog output using digital signals. 
00:42
To be why changing how long the signal stays high and low, we control the brightness of the LED. 
00:48
More time at high makes the LED brighter, More time at low makes the LED dimmer. 
00:53
This is how we create smooth brightness control. 
00:55
Now let us start.
00:57
Building the program first go to the events section and drag when Arduino begin.
01:02
Next, go to the control section and drag the forever block so the effect runs continuously. 
01:08
Now go to the variable section and create a variable named item with initial value 0 dot. 
01:13
Place this variable inside the forever block. 
01:15
Now go to the control section and drag a repeat block. 
01:19
Set it to 255 times which is the maximum value.
01:22
Or PWM. 
01:23
Inside this repeat block go to variables and drag change item by plus plus.
01:29
This increases the brightness step by step from zero to 255.
01:34
Next, go to the LED section and drag the LED analog write block. 
01:39
Set the LED pin to IO5 and put the variable item in the value field. 
01:44
Now go to control and add a weight block of 0.01 seconds.
01:49
This delay makes the brightness change smooth. 
01:53
Now we create the dimming part again. 
01:56
Add another repeat 255 times, block inside it, drag change item by. 
02:02
This decreases the brightness from 255 back to zero. 
02:06
Add the LED analog write IO5 value.
02:09
Item block again, then add another weight block of 0.01 seconds.
02:16
Now upload the program. 
02:18
After uploading, you will see the LED gradually getting brighter and then dimmer. 
02:23
It will keep repeating this smoothly.

00:42
Project helps us understand the basic working of Arduino, how pins work and how we control hardware using code. 
00:49
Now start connection connect red lead to IO5 of ESP board. 
00:53
Now let us start building the program step by step. 
00:57
First go to the events section and drag the block when Arduino begin.
01:02
This block runs only once when the board starts. 
01:06
Next go to the control section and drag the forever block. 
01:10
Lace it under the When Arduino begin block. 
01:13
This makes sure the LED keeps blinking continuously. 
01:16
Now go to the pin section and drag the block. 
01:19
Set IO5 pin to output.
01:22
This tells the board that the LED connected to pin IO5 will be used as an output device. 
01:29
Next, go to the LED section and drag the block LED pin IO5 out high. 
01:34
This turns the LED on. 
01:36
After that, go again to the control section and add a weight block. 
01:40
Set the wait time to one second.
01:43
Now go back to the LED section and drag the block LED pin IO5 out low.

Ultrasonic Adapter They small helper board that makes it easy to connect the ultrasonic sensor to the IT is clearly labeled pins such as VCC, Trigger, Echo, and ground. 
00:10
These labels match the pins of the ultrasonic sensor so wiring becomes simple and neat. 
00:15
The USB cable connects the no main board to a computer sending your program.
00:20
From the computer to the board and giving the board power. 
00:24
Without it you cannot upload new instructions. 
00:26
Once connected, the board runs the program and powers up your sensors and outputs.
          
For Sonic sensor, the ultrasonic sensor has two round eyes. 
00:03
One sends out sound waves and the other listens for echoes. 
00:07
These sound waves are too high pitched for humans to hear. 
00:10
This sensor is perfect for robots that need to avoid obstacles or measure how far away something is.
         
In this video, we'll explore the main board and all the exciting parts inside. 
00:09
Each component has a special job, some scents, some move, some light up, and some make sounds. 
00:15
Together, they bring your projects to life. 
00:17
Let's begin and discover how this kit makes engineering simple.
00:20
And fun
       
The steam sensor is a small module that detects moisture, steam or water droplets. 
00:04
When it senses wetness, it sends a signal to the main board. 
00:07
This makes it useful for projects like rain alarms or automatic fans when the air is humid.
          
360° servo motor can spin continuously in both directions. 
00:03
You can also control its speed and direction. 
00:07
This makes it useful for driving wheels or making parts of your project spin around endlessly. 
00:13
270° servo motor It doesn't spin continuously, but instead moves to the angle you command and stays there.
00:20
This makes it great for moving robotic arms, turning dials, or steering systems where precise control is needed.
         
Passive Buzzer The passive buzzer is a tiny speaker that makes sounds when it receives signals from the main board.
          
The board has digital pins and analog pins. 
00:02
It also has a tiny O LED screen that can show text or icons. 
00:06
The main board also has a reset button and a power switch making.
        
Lego compatible series includes building blocks and parts that fit together like Lego pieces. 
00:05
Joystick Module The joystick module looks like a mini game controller stick. 
00:09
It moves in two directions, left and right, up and down. 
00:13
It gives analog values for both the X axis and Y axis, which the main board can read.
        
The starting point for all your projects IR Remote control. 
00:02
The infrared remote control looks like a TV remote with many buttons. 
00:06
Each button sends out a unique infrared signal when pressed the IR receiver. 
00:10
This allows you to control your project from a distance, telling it to move forward, play a sound, or light up LED's just by pressing the.
    
The IR receiver is a small black module that catches invisible infrared signals. 
00:04
These signals come from an infrared remote control. 
00:06
When you press a button on the remote, the receiver gets the code and passes it to the main board.
         
Battery Holder The battery holder is designed to carry a bag.
       
The 130 motor is a simple DC motor module that can be directly connected to the Control Board without using an extra driver, making it ideal for small DIY projects. 
00:16
It works on a voltage range of 3.3 to 5 volts.
00:20
And its speed can be smoothly controlled using PWM. 
00:23
By changing the PWM duty cycle, the average voltage applied to the motor changes, which directly controls the rotation speed. 
00:31
The motor has two control pins, INA and INB, and the direction of rotation depends on which pin has the higher PWM.
00:40
Value. 
00:40
If I and B has a higher PWM value than INA, the motor rotates clockwise and if INA has a higher PWM value than inb, it rotates counterclockwise. 
00:51
When both pins are set to 0, the motor stops.
00:56
In this set, the motor is connected to port 9, where Ina is linked to IO 18 and INB to ion 19. 
01:04
In the program, the motor is first initialized and then inside a continuous loop it runs clockwise at full speed, slows down, stops and then repeats the same sequence in the opposite direction.
01:17
This experiment clearly demonstrates how PWM can be used to control both the speed and direction of a DC motor safely and effectively.
         
This experiment demonstrates the working of a capacitive touch sensor module which allows touch based switching without any mechanical parts. 
00:13
The sensor uses a capacitive area that detects changes in capacitance when a finger touches it.
00:20
Enabling reliable touch detection. 
00:21
After powering on, the sensor needs about 0.5 seconds to stabilize and perform self calibration, which lasts around 4 seconds, so it should not be touched during this. 
00:33
The module operates on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, consumes very low current.
00:40
And outputs a digital signal. 
00:42
Since it is blue housing, it is connected to a digital port of the main board and in this setup it is connected to port 4 corresponding to digital pin IO 27. 
00:52
When the capacitive area is touched, the sensor outputs a high signal and the onboard red LED turns on and when the touch is released.
01:00
The output goes low and the LED turns off. 
01:03
In the program, the pin mode and serial communication are initialized first and inside a continuous loop the digital value of IO27 is read and compared. 
01:13
If the value is equal to 1, the system recognizes that the sensor is being touched and prints. 
01:19
You press the button.
01:20
On the serial monitor and if the value is not equal to 1, it prints you loosen the button. 
01:27
A short delay of 0.1 seconds is added to refresh the reading smoothly and avoid unstable output. 
01:33
After uploading the code and setting the correct bod rate, touching and releasing the sensor will clearly show the corresponding messages on the serial monitor.
01:42
Confirming the correct operation of the capacitive touch sensor.
        
This project uses the DS18B20 digital temperature sensor to accurately measure environmental temperature and display the result through the serial monitor. 
00:15
The DS18B20 is a compact, high precision sensor with strong.
00:20
Anti interference capability and a wide detection range from -55°C to plus 125°C, making it reliable for many applications. 
00:27
Since it is a digital module with a blue housing, it is connected to a digital port on the Control Board and in this setup it is attached to port 6 which corresponds to digital pin.
00:41
IO23 In the program, the temperature sensor library is first added and the serial port is initialized so that data can be displayed correctly inside a continuous loop. 
00:52
The system reads the temperature value detected by the D18B20 and prints it to the serial monitor without wrapping, ensuring that the numeric value.
01:01
And its unit appear on the same line. 
01:04
After printing the temperature value, the unit degree C is printed with small spacing to improve readability. 
01:11
Once the code is uploaded and the bot raid is set correctly, the serial monitor continuously shows the real time temperature measured by the DS18B20 sensor, clearly demonstrating.
01:21
A digital temperature sensing and serial output worked together in a simple and effective way.
          
This project explains the working of the Five Channel AD Button module which is designed to save input ports by allowing 5 different buttons to be read using only one analog pin. 
00:16
The module works on the principle of voltage division, where.
00:20
Pressing each button produces a different output voltage. 
00:23
This voltage is read by the board's built in ADC, which converts the analog signal into a digital value. 
00:30
Since the board uses a 12 bit ADC with a 3.3 Volt reference, the analog input is converted into values ranging from zero to 4095.
00:40
In this set, the module is connected to the analog port 8 which corresponds to IO34. 
00:46
Inside the program, the pin mode is set and the serial port is initialized first.
00:52
Then in a continuous loop, the analog value from IO34IS read and stored in a variable and this value is printed on the serial monitor. 
01:02
Using conditional checks, the program compares the ADC value with predefined ranges to identify which button is pressed. 
01:09
If the value is below 500, it indicates that.
01:12
L button is pressed.
01:14
Values between 501,000 indicate SW-51000 to 2000 indicate SW-42000 to 3000 indicate SW three, 3000 to 4000 indicate SW 2 and 4000 to 5000 indicate SW1A. 
01:30
Short delay is added to refresh the readings.
01:35
Smoothly after uploading the code and setting the baud rate correctly, pressing different buttons displays the corresponding analog values and button names on the serial monitor, clearly demonstrating how multiple buttons can be detected using a single analog input.
    
The IR receiver module is used to receive signals from an infrared remote control and convert them into digital data that the Control Board can understand. 
00:14
It works on a voltage range of 3.3 to 5 volts and is designed to receive standard.
00:20
38 kHz infrared signals commonly used in TV's, air conditioners and other remote controlled devices. 
00:26
The transmitter sends modulated infrared light and the receiver detects this light, converts it into electrical signals and decodes the command. 
00:34
Since it is a digital module, it is connected to a digital port on the board.
00:41
In this set, the IR receiver is connected to port one, where the signal pin is linked to IO 13. 
00:48
In the program, the serial monitor is first initialized and the IR receiver pin is set inside a continuous loop. 
00:55
The program checks whether a signal has been received when a button on the remote is pressed.
01:01
The receiver captures the signal and prints the corresponding key value in hexadecimal format on the serial monitor. 
01:08
A short delay is added to avoid repeated readings from a single button press, and the receiver is refreshed so it can receive the next command. 
01:17
This experiment demonstrates how infrared communication can be used to control robots.
01:21
And electronic projects wirelessly.
        
Hello everyone, today we will learn about manual control mode where we control a fan using a capacitive touch sensor and a 130 motor. 
00:15
In this project the fan works in manual mode, meaning we start and stop it.
00:20
They simply touching the sensor. 
00:22
First we connect the board to the computer and upload the program. 
00:26
Then we focus on understanding how the logic works.
00:30
We begin by importing the DC motor library for ESP 32 and setting the touch sensor pin to IO 27.
00:37
Next, we create a variable called press and set its initial value to 0, which helps us track whether the fan is currently off or on.
00:46
Inside the forever loop, the program continuously checks the state of the touch sensor using a digital read. 
00:52
When the sensor is touched and the value at IO27 becomes one, the program checks the value of the press variable.
01:00
If press is 0, it means the fan is currently off, so the motor is activated using the motor analog write block. 
01:07
The fan starts rotating and the press variable is updated to 1.
01:12
When the sensor is touched again and IO27 reads one while press is already won, the program understands that the fan is running, so it stops the motor and resets press back to 0.
01:23
In this way, each touch acts like a toggle switch. 
01:26
One touch turns the fan on and the next touch turns it off. 
01:31
After uploading the code, we can test the project easily. 
01:35
Touching the capacitive module once starts the fan and touching it again stops the fan. 
01:41
This project clearly demonstrates how variables conditions.
01:43
And continuous loops work together to create a simple and effective manual control system using a touch sensor.
        
This experiment explains the working of a photo interrupter module, which operates using a builtin light source and a light receiver to detect interruptions in a light path. 
00:15
The module contains an LED as the light emitter and a photosensitive receiver with a signal.
00:21
Amplifier and When an object passes through the groove and blocks the light, the receiver detects no light, causing a change in resistance that is converted into a digital electrical signal. 
00:32
The photo interrupter works on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, draws about 20-4 milliamps of current, and outputs a digital signal, making it suitable for precise.
00:42
Object detection and counting applications. 
00:43
Since it has blue housing, it is connected to a digital port of the main board and in this setup it is connected to port 3 which corresponds to digital pin IO 26. 
00:54
When the light path is blocked, the module outputs a high signal and when the path is clear it outputs a low signal.
01:03
In the program, the pin mode and serial communication are initialized 1st and variables are created to store the current sensor state, the previous state, and a counter value. 
01:13
Inside a continuous loop. 
01:15
The system repeatedly reads the digital value from IO26 with a short delay to stabilize the readings, compares the current state with the last state.
01:24
And detects changes caused by an object entering or leaving the groove. 
01:28
Each time the light is interrupted, meaning the state changes from low to high, the counter is increased by 1 and the updated count is printed on the serial monitor. 
01:38
After processing, the current state is stored as the last state for the next cycle once the code is uploaded.
01:45
In the correct BOD rate is set. 
01:47
Placing and removing an opaque object through the sensor groove will result in the serial monitor displaying the number of times the light has been interrupted, demonstrating accurate detection and counting of passing objects.
          
Hello everyone, today we will learn how to control a fan using an IR remote by building the logic step by step with drag and drop programming blocks.
00:15
In this project we use events, variables, IR operators, motor and control blocks to read signals from the remote and control the fan speed. 
00:26
We begin by importing the DC motor and IR remote libraries, then initialize 4 variables. 
00:33
Key one_press_number key 2_press_number key three_press_number and, key with initial values of 0 where the first 3 variables store how many times keys 1-2 and three are pressed and the last variable stores the value received from the IR receiver while ina AND inb. 
00:51
Are set to 0 and the IR receiver pin is INITIALIZED as IO13Inside the forever loop, the program continuously checks whether an infrared signal is received. 
01:01
When a signal arrives, the received value is stored in the key variable and the IR receiver is refreshed.
01:09
If key one is detected, key one_press_number increases by 1 and the other two key variables are reset to 0. 
01:16
The fan at high speed, key 2 at medium speed, key three at low speed, and pressing the same key again stops the fan, clearly demonstrating how variables, conditions, loops and IR control work together.
01:29
In a practical project.
         
This experiment introduces the RGB LED module with a common anode, which combines three LED's, red, green and blue into a single unit to produce a wide range of colors, including white by mixing these primary colors.
00:20
In different proportions based on trichromatic theory. 
00:23
Unlike a white LED that emits white light directly, an RGB LED generates colors through additive color mixing, where equal intensities of red, green, and blue light produce white. 
00:35
The module operates on a DC voltage of 3.3 to 5 volts, consumes about 19.5.
00:42
Milliamperes of current and is designed to work within a temperature range of -10 to plus 50°C. 
00:48
It has four pins, 3 control pins for red, green and blue, and one common anode pin that connects to the positive power supply. 
00:57
In this setup the RGB LED module is connected to a white port.
01:02
On the main board, specifically port one where the red pen connects to IO12, the green pin to IO13, and the blue pen to IO 14. 
01:12
Each color is controlled digitally, so setting a pin high turns the corresponding color on, while setting it low turns it off. 
01:19
After initializing the pins as outputs the main program.
01:23
Runs in a continuous loop where the LED lights up red, then green, then blue, and finally white, with each color displayed for one second. 
01:32
Once the code is uploaded successfully, the visible result is an RGB LED smoothly cycling through red, green, blue, and white colors in a repeating sequence.
       
This temperature detection system automatically controls a fan based on the surrounding temperature. 
00:12
It uses a D18B20 temperature sensor to continuously monitor the temperature and A130DC motor to drive the fan.
00:20
The temperature sensor reads the current temperature and sends the value to the Control Board, where it is also displayed on the serial monitor. 
00:30
In the program, a temperature threshold of 30°C is set, which can be adjusted as needed. 
00:36
When the detected temperature rises above 30°C, the Control Board activates the motor using PWM.
00:42
Causing the fan to rotate and cool the system.
00:45
When the temperature drops to 30°C or below, the motor stops and the fan turns off automatically.
00:52
This setup demonstrates how sensors and motors can work together to create an automatic cooling system similar to those used in electronic devices and smart machines.
01:07
I don't know.
01:15
I can deal with you.
         
This project introduces the TM 1654 digit tube display module which uses a 0.36 inch red common cathode digital display driven by the TM1650 chip. 
00:16
The key advantage of this module is that it only requires.
00:21
2 signal wires to communicate with the main board using A2 wire serial protocol, which is similar to but not exactly the same as standard I2C, helping to save IO pins. 
00:32
The module operates at 3.3 to 5 volts and is connected to the green ports on the board after importing the TM1650 display library.
00:41
In the program, the display is first initialized, cleared and then turned on and an integer variable I is defined with an initial value of 0. 
00:50
Inside a continuous loop, the program checks whether the value of I is less than 999. 
00:55
If it is, the value of I is converted into a string and displayed on the 4 digit tube.
01:02
Then I is increased by one. 
01:04
If I reaches 999, it is reset back to zero so the counting can start again. 
01:10
A short delay of 0.01 seconds is added to control the refresh speed of the display. 
01:17
After uploading the code, the digital tube continuously counts from zero to 999.
01:22
And then repeats, clearly demonstrating how numbers can be displayed and refreshed smoothly using the TM 1654 digit tube module.
         
00:06
This trigger mode system allows the fan to turn on automatically when an object comes close to it. 
00:12
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of nearby objects and A130DC motor to drive the fan.
00:20
The ultrasonic sensor continuously sends out sound waves and calculates the distance based on the reflected signal, while the measured distance is displayed on the serial monitor. 
00:30
In the program, a distance threshold of 10 centimeters is set, which can be changed according to requirements when the detected distance becomes less than 10 centimeters.
00:40
The Control Board activates the motor using PWM, causing the fan to rotate. 
00:45
When the distance is equal to or greater than 10 centimeters, the motor stops and the fan turns off. 
00:52
This experiment demonstrates how distance sensing can be used to trigger automatic actions similar to touchless fans and smart safety systems.
01:01
It also helps learners understand sensor integration, real time decision making, and motor control and automation projects.
         
This project demonstrates how an ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between the sensor and an object by mimicking the natural echolocation ability of bats. 
00:15
The sensor works by sending out ultrasonic sound waves at a frequency of 40 kHz.
00:22
When these waves hit an obstacle, they are reflected back to the sensor. 
00:26
By measuring the time taken for the sound waves to travel to the object and return, the system calculates the distance accurately. 
00:34
In this setup, the ultrasonic sensor operates at 5 volts and can measure distances ranging from 2cm up to 400 centimeters.
00:43
Since the ultrasonic module cannot be connected directly to the board, a converter module is used and the sensor is connected to port 7 where the trigger pin is linked to IO16 and the echo pin to IO35. 
00:56
In the program, the ultrasonic library is added and the serial port is initialized first.
01:02
Inside a continuous loop, the system reads the distance detected by the sensor and prints the value on the serial monitor. 
01:10
A short delay is added to refresh the reading smoothly. 
01:14
After uploading the code, the serial monitor continuously displays the real time distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the nearby obstacle, clearly showing.
01:23
While ultrasonic ranging works in practical applications.
          
Hello everyone, in this project we are going to explore variable speed mode where we control the rotation speed of a small fan using a 5 channel AD button module and A130 motor after connecting the board.
00:20
And uploading the program. 
00:21
The system works by first initializing the required pin modes and starting the serial port for monitoring values. 
00:28
Inside the main loop, the program continuously reads the analog values from the AD button module to detect which button is pressed. 
00:36
Each button corresponds to a different speed level when button 5.
00:40
Pressed the fan speed is set to 40%, button four sets it to 60%, button three sets it to 80% and button 2 sets it to 100%, while button one stops the fan completely. 
00:52
To achieve accurate speed control, the program uses a map function which converts the speed range of zero to 100 into the PWM.
01:01
Range of 0 to 255. 
01:03
Since motor speed depends on the PWM duty cycle, this means each speed unit is mapped proportionally to a PWM value, allowing smooth and precise control without manual calculations. 
01:14
The mapped PWM value is then sent to the motor using the motor analog write block.
01:21
Making the fan rotate at the selected speed. 
01:24
By duplicating the same logic for different speed values, we can easily create multiple speed levels. 
01:30
After uploading the code. 
01:31
Pressing buttons from 5:00 to 2:00 increases the fan speed step by step from 40% to 100%, and pressing button one turns the fan off, clearly demonstrating.
01:42
While analog input mapping and PWM work together to implement an effective variable speed control system.

This experiment explains how the white LED module works and how it is controlled using the Easy Plug Control Board. 
00:13
An LED, or light emitting diode converts electrical energy into light and is commonly used as an indicator or display.
00:20
Element with different materials producing different colors such as red, green, yellow, and blue. 
00:25
The white LED module operates on 3.3 to 5 volts using a digital control signal and connects to a telephone socket interface. 
00:34
Since modules with blue housing are digital, the white LED is connected to a digital port.
00:41
And in this setup it is connected to port one, which corresponds to digital pin IO 13. 
00:46
The pin mode of IO 13 is set to output so the main board can send high or low signals to the LED's inside a continuous loop. 
00:54
The pin is set HIGH to turn the LED on, followed by a one second delay, then set LOW to turn the LED.
01:01
Off followed by another one second delay. 
01:03
This sequence repeats continuously, causing the LED to blink with a one second interval, and after uploading the code successfully, the result is a white LED that turns ON for one second and OFF for one second repeatedly.
Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo. 
00:08
In this project we are making a button press counter using Arduino and an LCD display. 
00:14
Each time the button is pressed the number on the display increases by 1.

Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo.
00:09
In this project we are building an LDR light detection project using an LDR sensor and Arduino.
00:16
An LDR or light dependent resistor helps Arduino detect the amount of light present in the surroundings.
00:23
This concept is used in real life in automatic St. 
00:27
lights, smart lamps, mobile phone brightness control and smart home lighting systems where devices respond automatically based on light intensity.
00:36
In the coding part, Arduino reads the analog value from the LDR sensor.
00:41
Using a simple if else condition, Arduino compares the light value with a fixed threshold and decides the output action.
00:48
For wiring connections, the LDR is connected in a voltage divider circuit and attached to an analog pin of Arduino.
00:56
An output device like an LED or relay is connected to a digital pin to indicate the detected light condition.
01:03
During testing, when light falls on the LDR, the sensor value increases.
01:09
When the LDR is covered to simulate darkness, the value decreases, confirming that the light detection system is working correctly.

00:13
Bluetooth controlled RGB LED using HC 05 and Arduino. 
00:17
This project helps us understand wireless communication.
00:20
And how we can control devices remotely using a smartphone. 
00:24
In this project, we use an HC05 Bluetooth module to send commands from a mobile phone to the Arduino. 
00:32
The Arduino receives these commands and controls A4 pin RGB LED accordingly. 
00:37
An RGB LED contains 3 colors inside it.
00:42
Red, green, and blue. 
00:43
By turning these colors on and off in different combinations, we can create many different colors like red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, and white. 
00:54
In our program, we use the software serial library to create a virtual Bluetooth communication channel on digital pins.
01:02
10:00 and 11:00 This allows the Arduino to talk to the HC 05 module. 
01:07
We define 3 pins, 6 for red, 7 for green and eight for blue and set them as output in the setup function.
01:16
Initially, all colors are turned off in the loop function. 
01:20
The Arduino continuously listens for incoming Bluetooth data. 
01:23
When we send a letter from the mobile app, the Arduino reads it and performs the corresponding action. 
01:30
If we send our, the RED LED turns on. 
01:33
If we send our, the RED LED turns off.
01:38
Similarly, G&G control the green LED's and B&B control the blue LED's.

Today we are going to demonstrate how to display a simple message on a 16 by 2 LCD using Arduino. 
00:15
In this project we use I2C communication to connect the LCD with Arduino. 
00:20
The code initializes the LCD and continuously prints the word hello on the display. 
00:25
Now let us understand the coding part.
00:29
1st we include the required libraries for I2C communication and LCD control. 
00:35
For this include libraries wire and liquid crystal_ITUC.
00:42
Then we define the LCD address and size with code liquid crystal_I too see LCD 0X27162 in the setup function. 
00:53
We start I2C communication, initialize the LCD and turn on the backlight with code wire dot begin.
01:03
Start I2C uses a four as SDA A5 as SCL LCD init initialize LCD LCD backlight in the loop function LCD dot clear LCD set cursor 00 LCD dot print.
01:23
Below delay 1000.
01:27
This code will clear the display, set the cursor position and print the text Hello repeatedly with a small delay. 
01:34
First decompile and then upload the code. 
01:36
Now connect the wires BCC to 5V of Arduino board, G&D to G&D of Arduino board, SDA two of four of Arduino board, SCL 2 of 5 of Arduino board.
01:48
After completing the wiring and uploading the code power on the Arduino, if the connections are correct, the LCD will display the message Hello.
01:58
If the display is blank, adjust the contrast knob on the LCD module. 
02:03
Is project demonstrates basic. 
02:05
I too see communication and LCD interfacing using Arduino.
     
00:06
Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo. 
00:08
In today's project we are going to learn how to interface a push button with a nice superscript 2C LCD display using Arduino. 
00:16
This is a very basic yet important project that.
00:20
Helps us understand input and output devices and embedded systems.
00:24
This concept is widely used in real life, For example in elevators, when you press a button, the selected floor number appears on a display.
00:34
Similarly, in digital attendance systems or ticket machines, pressing a button triggers a message on the screen. 
00:41
To build this project, we use an Arduino Uno, a push button, and a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD display. 
00:49
The I Superscript 2C LCD reduces wiring complexity by using only two data lines.
00:55
SDA and SCL along with power and ground. 
00:58
Before uploading the code we need to install the required library.
01:03
In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch, then Include Library, then Manage Libraries. 
01:08
Search for Liquid Crystal I2C and install it. 
01:12
In the program, we first include the wire library for our Superscript 2C communication and the Liquid Crystal I2C library to control the LCD. 
01:21
We then define the button pin.
01:23
As digital pin 3 and create an LCD object with address 0X27 and size 16 by two. 
01:30
In the setup function we configure the button as input pull, which means we do not need an external resistor.
01:38
Then we initialize the I Superscript 2C communication, start the LCD and turn on its backlight. 
01:44
In the loop function, we continuously read the button state. 
01:48
When the button is pressed, the Arduino detects a low signal, moves the cursor to the first row of the LCD and displays the message Hello when the button is released.
01:59
The screen is cleared for wiring. 
02:01
1 terminal of the button is connected to digital pin 3 and the other to ground.
02:07
The LCD's VCC connects to 5V, G&D to ground, SDA to a four and SCL to A5. 
02:14

This project is an RGB LED color control system using Arduino. 
00:10
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how different colors can be produced using a single RGB LED by controlling its three primary color components.
00:20
Red, Green and Blue. 
00:22
The RGB LED has three internal LEDs, Red, Green and Blue, which are connected to the Arduino through current limiting resistors.
00:32
By turning these LED's on and off in different combinations, we can generate multiple colors such as red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, and white. 
00:43
The Arduino is programmed to automatically cycle through different colors at regular intervals, creating a smooth and visually attractive lighting effect.
00:53
This project helps students understand digital output control, color mixing, and basic microcontroller programming.
01:01
It can be used in decorative lighting, mood lighting systems and creative electronic displays.
     
This project is a gas detection system using the MQ 135 gas sensor and Arduino. 
00:12
The main objective of this system is to monitor air quality and warn users when harmful gases are present. 
00:19
The MQ 135.
00:20
Sensor continuously detects gases such as ammonia, smoke, carbon dioxide and other pollutants. 
00:25
It sends an analog signal to the Arduino which is processed and displayed on a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD screen in real time.
00:36
When the gas level exceeds A predefined safe limit, the system turns on an LED as a visual warning. 
00:44
If the gas level is normal, the LED remains off and the LCD displays normal air. 
00:50
This project is useful in homes, kitchens, laboratories, industries, and safety monitoring systems and help students.
00:57
Understand sensor interfacing, analog data processing and real time monitoring using Arduino.
     
This project is a password protected appliance control system using Arduino designed to provide security and controlled access to electrical appliances. 
00:15
In this system a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD.
00:20
2 push buttons, a relay module and a letter interfaced with an Arduino Uno. 
00:24
The user enters A4 digit password using only two buttons. 
00:27
1 button is used to increment the digit from zero to 9 and the second button is used to confirm and move to the next digit.
00:37
The entered password is compared with the pre stored password in the Arduino. 
00:41
If the password is correct, the relay is activated allowing the connected appliance to turn on. 
00:47
If the password is incorrect, the lead gives an alert indicating unauthorized access.
00:53
All system status messages such as enter, password, access granted or wrong password are displayed on the LCD. 
01:01
This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems in security and automation.
01:08
It is useful for home security, smart access control and appliance protection, and help students understand button interfacing, LCD communication and relay control using Arduino.
     
00:06
In this project we have designed an LCD based sensor display system using Arduino and a 16 by two I Superscript 2C LCD. 
00:14
The main objective of this project is to monitor environmental parameters and display them in real time.
00:20
In an LCD screen, the system uses a DHT 11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and an LDR sensor to detect light intensity in the surrounding environment. 
00:31
These sensor values are continuously read by the Arduino Uno and processed internally.
00:37
Instead of using many wires, this project uses I Superscript 2C communication, which allows the LCD to work using only two data lines, SDA and SCL. 
00:49
This makes the circuit simple, compact and more reliable, especially for IoT and embedded system applications. 
00:56
The measured temperature.
00:57
Humidity and light intensity values are displayed on the 16 by 2 LCD in an easy to understand format, allowing users to monitor environmental conditions without the need for a serial monitor or computer connection.
01:12
This type of project is widely used in smart homes, whether monitoring systems, classrooms, greenhouses and industrial automation panels. 
01:20
It is an excellent project for students and beginners to understand sensor interfacing I Superscript 2C communication and real time data display using Arduino.
    
Hello my dear friends, today I am presenting my project called Automatic Light Control System. 
00:11
The aim of this project is to automatically turn a light on or off based on surrounding light conditions to save electricity.
00:20
In this project, an LDR sensor detects the light intensity and sends its value to the microcontroller. 
00:27
When the surroundings become dark, the LDR value decreases and the microcontroller activates the relay, which works as an electrically operated switch and turns the light on.
00:38
When sufficient light is present, the relay turns off and the light switches off automatically. 
00:44
The relay is connected using calm and and no terminals along with the resistor for safety. 
00:49
This project is very useful for street lights, home automation and energy saving applications.
00:55
Thank you.     
In this project we are implementing a temperature based LED control project using Arduino Uno, DHT 11 sensor and a relay module where an LED turns on automatically when the temperature rises above a set limit.
00:20
Arduino Uno acts as the controller, DHT 11 works as the temperature sensor and the relay acts as an electrically operated switch. 
00:28
The DHT 11 sensor is connected with its VCC to 5V, data pin to digital pin, D7 and G&D to ground.
00:38
The relay module is connected with in one to D8BCC to 5V and G&D to G&D, and since the relay is a low level trigger module, it turns on when the lowest signal is applied. 
00:50
The LED is connected through the normally open terminal of the relay, with its positive connected to 5V through a resistor and its negative connected to the.
00:59
Now terminal while Cam is connected to ground.
01:03
In the code, the DHT library is used to read the temperature value and Arduino continuously checks if the temperature exceeds 30°C. 
01:11
If it does, Arduino sends a low signal to the relay pin, turning on the relay and lighting the LED's and if the temperature.
   
    Good morning my dear friends. 
00:08
Today I am very happy to present my project titled Relay Controlled LED System using a Microcontroller. 
00:13
The main objective of this project is to understand how a relay can be used as an electrically operated.
00:20
Switch to control devices safely and efficiently. 
00:23
In this system, each LED has two terminals known as the anode and a cathode.
00:29
The cathode of each LED is connected directly to ground, while the anode is connected through a 220 ohm current limiting resistor to the calm terminal of the relay. 
00:39
The no or normally open terminal of the relay is connected to a 5 Volt power supply. 
00:44
When the relay is in the off state, the circuit remains open so no current flows.
00:49
And the LED stays off.
00:52
When the microcontroller sends a signal to the relay through the programmed code, the relay turns on and the comment and no terminals get connected, completing the circuit and allowing current to flow through the resistor and LED, causing the LED to light up.
     
In this project we are implementing a button controlled relay project using Arduino Uno and a 2 channel relay module where a push button is used to manually control the relay operation. 
00:17
Arduino Uno acts as the controller the push button.
00:20
Acts as an input device and the relay module is used to switch external electrical devices. 
00:26
The relay module is a 5 Volt optic coupler based low level trigger relay, meaning the relay turns on when the input signal is low.
00:35
For wiring, the push button is connected between digital pin D2 and G&D. 
00:40
Relay in one is connected to D8, in two to D9, while VCC and GND D of the relay are connected to 5V and G&D of Arduino. 
00:49
In the code the button pen is configured as input_pull up so the pin reads high.
00:55
Normally and low, when the button is pressed, both relay pins are set as output and initially kept off by sending high signals.
01:04
Inside the loop function, Arduino continuously reads the button state and when the button is pressed it sends low signals to both relay pins to turn them on, and when the button is released it sends high signals to turn them off. 
01:19
This project helps students understand digital input reading, low level relay control, and basic manual automation concepts.
    
In this project we are working on a 2 channel relay on and off control project using Arduino Uno where Arduino Uno acts as the main controller and a fivefold optocoupler based low level trigger relay module is used to control electrical devices.
00:21
The relay module is connected such that in one is connected to digital pin D8, in two is connected to digital pin, D9DC is connected to 5V and G&D is connected to G&D.
00:35
In the Arduino code we 1st declare 2 integer variables to store the relay pin numbers and then inside the setup function we set both pins as output using the pin mode function and keep both relays off initially by sending high signals because this relay works on low level triggering.
00:53
In the loop function, Arduino sends a low signal to pin D8 to turn on relay one while keeping relay 2 off. 
00:59
Then after a delay of two seconds, it turns relay one off and sends a low signal to pin D9 to turn on relay 2, and after another delay it sends high signals to both pins to turn both relays off.
01:13
This process keeps repeating continuously, allowing us to observe the relay switching through LED indicators and clicking sounds. 
01:19
And through this project, students learn how digital output pins work, how low level triggered relays operate, and how Arduino can be used for basic automation and control applications.
        
Welcome to Wiz Robo.
00:08
In this project we are creating a simple alert system using Arduino, a push button, an RGB LED and a buzzer. 
00:16
This system is useful for emergency alarms, security systems and classroom call buttons where a person can press a button to give an alert. 
00:25
In the code we define the button pin RGB.
00:28
LED pins and buzzer pin and set them as input and output in the setup function. 
00:34
In the loop function, Arduino continuously checks the button state.
00:39
When the button is pressed, the system goes into alert mode, the red color of the RGB LED turns on and the buzzer starts beeping.
00:47
When the button is not pressed, the system stays in safe mode, the green LED turns on, and the buzzer remains off. 
00:54
For wiring, we connect the button to pin 2 and ground, the RGB red pen to pin 9, green pen to pen 10, the common pin to ground, and the buzzer to pin 8 and ground.
01:06
After uploading the code, we test the system by pressing the button and observing the red light and buzzer and releasing the button to see the green light and buzzer off. 
01:17
This project helps us understand how input and output devices work in Arduino. 
01:21
Thank you for watching WAS Robo and keep learning robotics and coding.
        
Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo. 
00:08
Today we are going to learn a very exciting project Bluetooth controlled LED using HCP 05 and Arduino. 
00:16
This project helps us understand wireless communication.
00:20
Between a mobile phone and an embedded system. 
00:23
In this project we use an HC 05 Bluetooth module to send commands from a smartphone to the Arduino. 
00:31
The Arduino receives these commands and controls an LED accordingly. 
00:35
The HC05 module communicates with Arduino using serial communication.
00:40
When we send a signal from the mobile app, the HCP 05 receives it and transfers it to the Arduino through its TX and RX pins. 
00:49
In our program, we use the software serial library to create a virtual serial communication channel on digital pins 10 and 11.
00:57
The Arduino continuously listens for incoming Bluetooth data. 
01:00
When we send one from the mobile phone, the Arduino turns the LED on. 
01:06
When we send 0, the Arduino turns the LED off. 
01:10
This shows how we can control electronic devices wirelessly.
01:14
This concept is widely used in real life, such as Bluetooth controlled home automation, smart lights, wireless robots and remote controlled appliances. 
01:23
After uploading the code, we pair our phone with the HC05 module and use a Bluetooth app to send commands. 
01:31
When we press 1, the LED glows and when we.
01:34
Rest zero, it turns off. 
01:38
Congratulations.
01:39
You have successfully built a Bluetooth controlled LED system.
01:43

Now let us understand the wiring connections. 
00:08
Connect one leg of the push button to pin 6 and the other leg to ground. 
00:13
You can use a resistor or internal pull up for stable reading.
00:18
The servo motor has three wires.
00:21
The red wire goes to five volts.
00:23
The brown or black wire goes to ground.
00:26
The yellow or orange wire goes to pin 13. 
00:30
Connect Arduino to the computer using a USB cable.
00:34
Open Arduino ID and Serial Monitor to see button values. 
00:38
Upload the block code to Arduino.
00:41
Press the button and the servo will rotate to 20°. 
00:46
Release the button and the servo will rotate back to 90°. 
00:50
This project is used in automatic doors, robotic arms, and smart gate systems. 
00:56
You can improve this project by adding LED's or buzzers for alerts. 
01:01
Keep practicing.
01:02
Keep building projects and keep learning robotics with Wise Robo. 
01:06
Thank you for watching.
        
Hello everyone, welcome to Wiz Robo. 
00:09
Today we are going to learn a very interesting project Bluetooth based temperature monitoring system using HC05 and DHT 11 sensor. 
00:18
This project helps us understand.
00:20
Wireless communication and real time data monitoring. 
00:23
In this project we use a DHT 11 temperature and humidity sensor to measure the surrounding environment. 
00:30
The sensor sends this data to the Arduino in digital form.
00:35
The Arduino then transmits the temperature and humidity values wirelessly to a mobile phone using the HC05 Bluetooth module. 
00:43
The HC05 communicates with Arduino using serial communication on pins 10 and 11. 
00:49
In our program, we use the DHT library to read temperature and humidity.
00:55
Every two seconds the Arduino sends updated sensor values to the Bluetooth terminal app on our phone.
01:02
This type of system is used in smart homes, whether monitoring greenhouse automation and industrial temperature control systems. 
01:09
After uploading the code, we pair our phone with the HC05 module and open the Bluetooth terminal app. 
01:16
Instantly, we can see live temperature and humidity readings on our mobile screen.
01:22
Congratulations.
01:24
You have successfully built a Bluetooth temperature monitoring system. 
01:28
Keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep building with Wise Robo.
       
Now I will explain how this program works step by step. 
00:10
When the Arduino starts, it first opens serial communication at 9600 baud rate. 
00:15
Then the OLED display is initialized and cleared so it is ready to show.
00:20
Symbols.
00:21
The IR receiver is also initialized on pin 6 and both servos are set to their starting positions, so the crane is in a stable state.
00:30
Inside the forever loop, the Arduino keeps checking if any data is received from the IR remote.
00:36
Whenever a button is pressed, the IR receiver reads the hex value of that button and refreshes for the next command. 
00:43
Each hex value is linked to a specific action. 
00:46
For example, when 1 button is pressed, the OLED shows a symbol and a servo on pin 13 rotates slightly to move the crane left or right.
00:56
Another button makes the servo rotate in the opposite direction.
01:01
When the up button is pressed, the servo on pin 12 moves to raise the object and when the down button is pressed, the servo moves back to lower the object.
01:10
At the same time, the OLED display updates to show arrows or icons so we can visually understand what action the crane is performing. 
01:19
This project helps us learn how IR remote communication works, how different inputs can control motors, and how multiple components like servos and OLED displays can work together to create a smart machine.
         
In this project we create an automatic CSI using a Control Board and a servo motor. 
00:11
A seesaw normally moves up and down when children push with their feet, but here the movement is controlled electronically.
00:19
The servo motor is connected to pin 13 of the main board, with its power and ground properly connected. 
00:25
When the program starts, the board sends angle and delay commands to the servo motor. 
00:30
By changing the angle value, the servo rotates in a specific direction and speed, which makes one side of the seesaw rise while the other side falls.
00:40
An angle close to 90 slows or stops the rotation, while values lower or higher than 90 control the direction and speed. 
00:47
With the added delay, the motion becomes smooth and continuous, giving the seesaw A realistic up and down movement.
00:55
This project helps students understand how servo motors work, how angles control motion, and how simple coding can automate mechanical movements in real life models.
          
This rope skipping machine uses a joystick module, a 360° servo motor, and a passive buzzer to create an automatic skipping system.
00:15
The joystick works using I2C communication and provides 2 analog values X&Y ranging from zero to 1023 along with a digital button output in the neutral position. 
00:28
Both X&Y values are around 512. 
00:31
The 360° servo motor is connected to pin D13.
00:36
And is controlled by changing its angle value. 
00:39
When the servo angle is set to 90°, the motor stops rotating.
00:44
If the angle is less than 90°, the servo rotates in One Direction and if it is greater than 90° it rotates in the opposite direction. 
00:53
By changing how far the value is from 90°, the speed of rotation can be increased or decreased.
01:01
In the program, the joystick values are continuously read inside a loop. 
01:05
If the X axis value is greater than 512, the rope rotates in One Direction. 
01:11
If it is less than 512, the rope rotates in the opposite direction.
01:17
This allows the skipping direction and speed to be controlled smoothly using the joystick.
01:22
When the joystick button is pressed, the passive buzzer plays a sound giving audio feedback to the user. 
01:29
This.

01:01
Maybe we can make JP grow and shrink. 
01:03
You can make a character get bigger by changing the size.
01:08
And get smaller by typing a -Let's put this change size by 10 block in a repeat loop. 
01:20
This makes the character grow gradually.
01:22
We can put the change size by -10 block in a repeat loop too.
01:28
And I'll add a sound.
01:33
Now let's also have this code run when we click this Sprite.
01:37
Yeah.
01:39
Click the green arrow for more ideas. 
01:41
What will you create?
     
With Scratch you can animate an adventure game. 
00:12
I want Garnet to be my main character. 
00:15
You can pick any one you want and if you can't see your character.
00:20
Click on their icon and you can make them show up or hide by clicking these buttons on and off. 
00:26
Click on the icon of your character and now you can program them to do things in Scratch. 
00:32
You drag out blocks of code from here to make programs here which will make things happen here on the stage. 
00:38
Now let's make our game.
00:40
As you watch, you can pause the video and try each step. 
00:43
First try going to the looks category and dragging out a save block to make your character say something.
00:50
Now I want to make my character follow the mouse so that I can move her around the screen. 
00:56
To do this, go to the motion category, drag out the block that says Glide 1 seconds to random position and choose mouse pointer from the menu. 
01:04
Attach this block under the say block and let's see what happens. 
01:08
Cool. 
01:08
She talked and then went to my mouse pointer.
01:11
But we want our main character to always follow our mouse pointer. 
01:15
To do this, try dragging out a loop from the control category. 
01:18
When you put code in a loop, that code will happen over and over again.
01:25
Awesome, now we can move our character with the mouse pointer. 
01:28
You can put in a smaller number like .3 if you want your character to move faster. 
01:33
Let's attach this loop back under the save block and put a when green flag clicked block on top and now we can start the game by clicking the green flag.
01:43
Now let's make our character collect items. 
01:45
Click on the icon of the item you want and now you can program the item. 
01:50
Make sure you click show to make your item show up. 
01:53
What should we make the item do? 
01:55
I think that when Garnet catches the gem, I want it to play a sound and then go to a new random place to do this.
02:03
Go to the control category and drag out a Wait until block. 
02:07
Go to the sensing category and grab the block that says Touching mouse pointer and choose your main character from the menu. 
02:13
My main character is Garnet, so I'll choose Garnet, but if Finn was your main character, you'd choose Finn.
02:20
And put that block inside the wait until block. 
02:23
Add a start sound block to make it play a sound and then add a go to random position block to make it go to a random place. 
02:31
And let's add a green flag block on top.
02:38
There we go. 
02:39
The gem waits until Garnet touches it, then plays a sound and goes to a new place. 
02:44
But I want it to do this over and over again, so try dragging out another forever loop and putting the code inside.
02:59
Awesome, we've got a game going. 
03:00
Finally, let's add a score. 
03:02
To do this, go to the variables category and create a variable called score or whatever you want to call it.
03:11
Try dragging out a change variable block and choosing score. 
03:14
And if you put this code inside the loop, the score will increase every time your character catches the item. 
03:20
And let's reset the score to 0 when the game is restarted.
03:30
Click the green arrow to see each step and to find out how to add more levels.
    
00:09
You can use Scratch to make a chase game. 
00:12
To start, let's pick a backdrop.
00:17
Now let's pick a Sprite.
00:20
I'll choose the octopus. 
00:22
Let's make it move when I press the arrow keys.
00:27
When I press the right arrow key, we can make it move right?
00:33
And left arrow to move left.
00:43
Let's add a Sprite to chase.
00:47
I'll choose this star. 
00:48
Let's make this bright move around randomly.
01:05
Click the green arrow to see this code and to see what else you might add to your game.    
You can use Scratch to tell a story, create a conversation, switch scenes, or do whatever else you can imagine to get started. 
00:15
Let's pick a background. 
00:17
I'll go with the Witch House now.
00:20
Let's pick a Sprite. 
00:21
I'll pick the wizard.
00:25
Let's have our character say something. 
00:27
I'll have my character say welcome to magic school.
00:36
I'd like to add another character, so I'll choose another Sprite. 
00:39
This time I'll pick the elf.
00:42
It looks like the elf isn't facing the wizard, so I'll change the way they're looking. 
00:47
Let's go to the costume tab and choose Flip Horizontal. 
00:50
So the costume is now flipped to face the wizard. 
00:52
Let's make a conversation. 
00:53
I'll add a save block to the elf Sprite. 
00:56
I'll make this character say I'm going on a quest.
01:00
Let's click the green flag to see what happens.
01:04
They both speak at the same time, so let's go ahead and add a weight block before the elf speaks.
01:10
I'll make this 2 seconds.
01:16
Let's have the characters change scenes. 
01:19
I'll add another background. 
01:20
This time I'll choose Mountain.
01:25
I'll reselect the ELF Sprite and go back to the coating area.
01:29
Let's have the characters start at the witch house.
01:35
Wait 4 seconds, which is how long the conversation is.
01:40
And then switched to the mountain backdrop.
01:49
Finally, what if we don't want the wizard to be in the mountain scene? 
01:53
Let's go back to the wizard Sprite and add a when backdrop switches to block.
01:59
I'll set it to mountain and make the wizard hide.
02:05
Let's try it out.
02:12
Looks good. 
02:12
Now let's replay the project. 
02:14
The wizard doesn't show up at all. 
02:16
That's because we've hidden it. 
02:17
So what we'll need to do is add a show block at the top of the script so that whenever someone replays the project, the wizard will show first.
02:33
Click the green arrow to see this code again and explore what else you might add to your story.
    
You can use your webcam to interact with your Scratch projects, PETA, virtual animal pop balloons, or anything else you can imagine. 
00:15
To start, let's add the video sensing extension.
00:20
So as you can see, it turns on our webcam and gives us a new set of blocks to play with. 
00:26
Let's start by making a simple project where we pet the cat. 
00:30
I'll grab the win. 
00:31
Video motion is greater than 10 block. 
00:33
So the way this block works is it's measuring the amount of motion that happens underneath the Sprite and it's measured.
00:40
On a scale of zero to 100, so 0 is no movement and 100th as much movement as we can do, let's go ahead and stick with the default value of 10. 
00:49
So next I'll grab a play sound until done, block and attach it. 
00:53
So let's give it a shot.
00:57
Maybe we'll try a higher value like 95 just to see what happens. 
01:01
OK, so nothing's happening.
01:04
Really, really have to do a lot of motion. 
01:06
So maybe, maybe we go back to 10.
01:09
Cool, I can't wait to see what you do with video sensing.
     
You can make a character fly. 
00:07
It could be anyone flying anywhere. 
00:10
Start by choosing a character to fly with.
00:14
Next, let's pick something to fly past. 
00:17
It can be anything. 
00:19
I'll pick buildings.
00:21
To make our character look like it's moving, we can move the scenery behind it.
00:27
Let's use change acts to move the building across the screen.
00:31
Let's try a negative number to make it look like it's going past it.
00:36
Let's make it repeat.
00:40
Perhaps 50 times.
00:44
Let's have our building start all the way to the right. 
00:47
We can use set X.
00:51
0 is going to be in the middle, so let's try a higher number. 
00:55
I'll try 250.
01:00
Let's have it keep going forever.
01:10
We can start this script by pressing the green flag.
01:17
To learn how to make your character move with arrow keys, add a score or fly with a crew, click the green arrow.
    

Hi everyone, welcome back to the podcast club. 
00:03
And as you all remember last time or we had done and that was all about how to create your own creative titles for the podcast using headline creator said to day we're going to be moving on to another website, another mode of the podcast.
00:21
It's called Zen caster.com Zed.
00:28
Dr.com and this is the platform where we will be recording our podcasts in the studio quality like we have recording studios basically then cast as a platform that provides you with high quality of podcasting recording. 
00:45
So you have to come to this website.
00:48
Make your own account and if you haven't signed up, simply click upon tries and caster for free to make your account and then you have to enter your first name, your last name, user name, e-mail and password and then sign up. 
01:05
That's all you have to do and make sure you always.
01:09
Do it under the guidance of your parents so that they know on which websites you're making the accounts and if you already have an account that you will have after signing up, you have to go and click upon login.
01:24
And after you've logged in, that's how your screen would look like. 
01:28
But you won't be able to see any episodes here 'cause these are all like my recordings. 
01:33
But for you, it will be empty if this is that's the first time you're signing in, or the 1st, or if you haven't even made an episode. 
01:42
So for Zen Caster, he basically can create an episode to start a podcast.
01:46
Recording backing upon creating episode, but this will be done a little bit later. 
01:52
For now we are only by understanding the basics. 
01:55
So in this, what a good feature about recording with Zen Caster is that the audio quality comes better even if you are facing network issues still.
02:06
The voice is crystal clear. 
02:08
Like I love that about Zen Caster. 
02:11
When it comes to the video quality in Zen Caster, when you're recording and see, when you record with video as well and you want to post it on YouTube or anywhere else, the video quality is perfect. 
02:24
It's like 1080 pixels now, the normal 720 pixels.
02:27
Then you have that you have like when your zoom or teams but here it has 1080 pixels and that's way better than normal camera quality. 
02:36
That's why people say it's a port. 
02:38
Proper pseudo recording way of podcasting. 
02:40
So if you see your episodes, all of them that you record here will be saved and you will also delete them.
02:47
If you want after you've recorded, but then they won't be permanently deleted. 
02:51
They will only be like archived in a way give me and you know what I mean. 
02:57
They'll just be removed from displaying in the dashboard, but it will be there in your like, you know, Dropbox the card as well or your Google Drive if you want to connect it.
03:08
Then you have like credits, but you don't need to add any post production credits because it's just you doing it. 
03:14
That's just when you have like you know anybody working for the post production and you want to give credence to the person, then you can put that here, but there's no need. 
03:24
Then we have connected to cloud drives. 
03:26
I just talked about that.
03:28
Whatever records that you would record would automatically be sent to Dropbox or Google Drive, and then you can see your account here.
03:38
If you have to check any illness, see what is your user info and I'll still be able to see how much you've been doing or how active you are. 
03:48
And then if you do and you pay for getting more space but like I don't think you would need to pay because it already provides you with 35 GB space.
03:58
And that's too like you know much because it won't take much space for you when you're recording your episodes. 
04:05
And then you have like log out. 
04:07
If you want to log out from here, you can also go ahead and check out these blog Falls Ancaster, where they provide you with lots of, you know, info about.
04:18
Our podcasting is done and then basically what is podcast guest forms, what will how to release them just about like basic guards about using podcasts, I mean Zen Caster then you have like support. 
04:32
So if you are facing some issues, you can always go and go to supportcertaincast.com.
04:39
And you can always go have checked the articles from here and you can also use the chat bot here to write your questions. 
04:47
And if you have any questions, they would reply and 30 minutes to you. 
04:52
So that's our basics of Zen Caster. 
04:55
All I wanted to do was right now to understand what's Ancaster.
05:00
And make sure that you have an account ready in the class itself. 
05:03
You can only use. 
05:04
Go ahead, get the computer and then make an account. 
05:07
And then I'll meet you at the next class. 
05:09
We'll be understanding how to create an episode. 
05:11
Thank you. 
05:12
Have a nice day.
    
Hi everyone, welcome to another class of the podcast club. 
00:04
And as you remember, last time we had learned about how to create an anchor account and what are the features is anchor. 
00:13
So after setting up all of the things to day, we'll be learning how you can create.
00:20
Their own podcast title. 
00:22
And for that you have to search for course schedule decom headline Analyzer or if you just search headline analyzer on Google, the first website that you would get in the description would be go schedule.com.
00:40
You have to click upon that and it will open up the website. 
00:45
So you have to create an account as well on this website. 
00:49
So when you type your headline here, as you can see it will ask you to make an account. 
00:56
But before that what exactly is headline analyzer? 
00:58
So here you can create.
01:00
Their own creative headlines and whatever you have thought, you can type it in here and then it will give you the percentage of how much accurate or how much creative, how much are powerful your headline is. 
01:15
So if your headline comes above 50%, it's good to go. 
01:19
But we can always.
01:20
Improve ourselves and I'll be putting in my headline here right now and then we'll see what all the features the headline headline analyzer provides us with. 
01:33
So let me quickly type the podcast name of my podcast. 
01:38
Each one teach 10-and amazing.
01:44
World of STEM and then you have to click upon analyze now and then you have to create an account. 
01:51
So you just have to get the full name, e-mail ID, company name. 
01:56
I don't think this is required but so you can add any company name here or if you have any company website URL.
02:04
So you can put that here and then also add the password.
02:09
After you have entered all the credentials, it will open up the account that you have just made and then it shows the headline score. 
02:18
So it gives me a 57, a headline score out of 100. 
02:22
That is a good score, not that bad, but like it doesn't always mean that you have to get.
02:29
100 and 100 score, it depends upon how how the headline has to work according to you. 
02:36
So it gives me a headline score of 57 out of which it gives me suggestions as well like you. 
02:43
In increase more emotional words you can decrease more common words you can increase the word count partly.
02:50
3 words and then you could rephrase your sentences. 
02:53
So here it shows me that each one each turn and then this means a common word. 
03:00
As you can see a thick this is a powerful word amazing an uncommon is world. 
03:06
Then we have again a common word and strength so.
03:10
First of all I hashtag it, did not realize what exactly it is so that might be a problem. 
03:16
And many of them don't know what stem is, so just took it as a noun here and it has given me more description of how I could decrease the common words. 
03:27
How how much is the limit for the uncommon?
03:30
Words and here it says 0% for emotional. 
03:33
So that means I could add more emotional words here and then I have one power words. 
03:38
If I want I can add more.
03:44
And then here it says that you can add a few more words to grab attention, but I believe that if it is too long it would actually take away the attention. 
03:55
So it should be around like 5 words. 
03:58
5 to 6 words is perfectly alright and mine is about 12345.
04:02
Exciting 6 was good to go. 
04:04
Don't go beyond 6 words because that becomes too lengthy. 
04:08
Then it says 43. 
04:09
Can't pick count um.
04:12
Our 50 to 60 character counts is OK, but not more than that. 
04:17
And then it says what is reading grade level. 
04:20
It gives the sentiment how people would take this as it gives me a positive sentiment and then I'm also able to see if I'm if I have the.
04:32
Ability to scheme this or not. 
04:33
So if I have to skim a path that means cut out a part, it will show me that which part could be skimmed. 
04:40
So it says amazing and world. 
04:42
So actually it is not very necessary that you have to do all of them. 
04:47
But if you want to try it out, you can always do that.
04:52
And that's exactly the headline scored that you would try on your own in the SEO's core. 
04:59
It basically gives you the quality of your arm headline. 
05:04
It gives me an 88% high quality. 
05:07
It shows how many keywords do you have and it will also shows.
05:12
That OHH, would it be visible to the audience when they would search it as a website or what is the score when it comes to 1 to 8? 
05:22
And it gives me a score between 6:00 to 7:00. 
05:25
So that is good. 
05:26
And also you can see that how you could increase your limit here. 
05:30
So that means if it's 54 then.
05:33
That could increase to 5860 and it gives you also more and more inspiration to make your headline better. 
05:40
So that was all about what exactly Headliner is and I wish that you all try this thing because it will help you to make your podcast headlines better.
05:53
And I'm sure by that by now you already have thought what your podcast would be about. 
05:59
So let's get ready and let's get get up and start creating our headlines and our podcast titles and use headliner to make it better. 
06:08
So thank you so much. 
06:10
See you in the next class Bye.
 
(0:00) Hi everyone, today we'll be learning about how to use Anchor and for that we have to (0:08) go ahead search for anchor.fm. So this is a website that's an easiest way to make, (0:15) create, distribute and multihouse your podcast all for free. You don't need to pay at all to get (0:22) started for signing in into this website and it automatically links to lots of other platforms as (0:30) well where people can listen to your podcast. In this video we'll be learning just about the (0:36) basics of anchor and what are the features of anchor.
So first of all if you don't have an (0:42) account on anchor we have to come here to this top right corner and we have this yellow icon of sign (0:49) up. Click upon that and then it asks you for your full name, your email id and password. So these (0:57) are the credentials that you have to fill on your own.
Just for the date of birth you have to make (1:03) sure that it is above the age of 18 that means if you are putting an age of 16 so you won't be able (1:12) to make an account on anchor and it is important that if you are under the age of 18 and you're (1:18) making an account then it should be under the guidance of your parents and they should know (1:23) that you made an account here. They should know the email id and password. So put in your month, day, year (1:29) and it should be that the year that you put in should be like it is telling you above the age of (1:35) 18 and then I'm not a robot sign up.
If you already have an account you can click upon sign in and then (1:43) enter your email id and password. So after you're signed in you'll be able to see your dashboard (1:50) but the only difference it is that if you have signed up for the first time it wouldn't look like (1:56) this. It'll be like you have to complete a few steps of making your podcast name, description, (2:01) create a cover art and many other things.
So for now let me just quickly explain you all the features (2:07) of the anchor website. So the first thing we have here is your podcast description. So this icon (2:16) here means edit.
So under that you can give your podcast a name like I have given (2:22) hashtag each one teach 10 and amazing world of 10. Under that we have a podcast description. (2:29) So this is really important that we're giving a description it should be strong enough (2:33) and it should be catchy enough to attract people and so is for the podcast name.
If it is too long (2:41) or too short it won't attract people to your podcast. But if it is a medium number of letters (2:48) and characters such as a 43 and 507 that's good to go but it should have good quality of information (2:55) as well. Then you have your cover art.
So this can be made through different softwares like Canva, (3:02) Adobe Spark and many other and then you can either download the art and also update it if (3:08) you don't want to change if you don't like it and you want to change this you click upon update (3:13) cover art. Then we have podcast category. So there's lots of categories that we have such as books, (3:21) design, performing arts, we have how to, we have crafts, we have astronomy, we have film history, (3:29) TV reviews and many other.
So I have chosen education because my podcast is about STEM, (3:35) game based learning and many things that can be done in the classroom for better engagement. So (3:41) that's why I've chosen the podcast category of education. Then we have content, clean or explicit.
(3:50) So clean means it is available for everybody or explicit means that only a certain group of age (3:57) can hear to that podcast. Then we have show anchor logo and cover art. So I haven't enabled that (4:05) I just want my people to see only my cover art and not the anchor logo so you can turn that off (4:11) from here.
Then we have show voice messages button on your anchor profile. So this means that if I go (4:19) to the anchor profile I'll be able to see a show voice button there where people can record messages (4:25) to me and send that to me. Just like in YouTube we have the comment section similarly in anchor (4:32) profile we have voice messages.
Then we can also include them in our podcast descriptions. (4:38) So that means if I have used one of the voice messages in my podcast then it automatically (4:44) will be added in the description. Next we have podcast language.
So we can choose from any (4:50) language. I have chosen English. You can choose whatever appeals to you the most.
Then we have (4:55) the account settings. Under that we have the display name that is your name. Then you have (5:01) the email ID your website and then you can also give your anchor custom URL.
So this means that (5:09) if you have google.com slash and then you're searching something so you can see I've got a (5:15) FM slash dashboard that podcast that edit. Similarly I have made my own URL anchor.fm (5:22) slash wonder Namya. It cannot be more than 25 characters.
So make sure that you have it as (5:28) small as possible. Then you can also add your own connections. If you don't have any accounts (5:34) that's OK.
I've added my Twitter account Instagram and YouTube. You can also go ahead add your own (5:40) connections if you want. And yeah that's all about the podcast settings that we have and (5:49) hope you're clear about what exactly a podcast is.
So if you haven't saved the changes then you (5:55) should always click upon save. Otherwise just cancel them if you don't want to save it. So then (6:00) if you scroll down you can also see number of plays you've had in the entire time of your podcast (6:06) and what was the estimated audience based on the recent episodes who are your unique listeners and (6:13) it also shows the current balance.
So for now I believe the current balance only works in Canada (6:20) and United States. But I guess they're trying to come to other countries as well. Next it shows (6:27) the podcast performance.
You can always alter that to daily weekly and monthly. Then we have the top (6:34) episodes. How many views we've got.
And I believe that the first episode always gets the most views. (6:40) That's a fact. Then we have your listeners.
So it shows the exact geographic location. If I go (6:47) under India I can see from Punjab, from Tamil Nadu, from Odisha, Assam and many other. Then we have (6:55) from United States we have Indiana, New Jersey, Georgia, New Hampshire, Illinois and many other.
(7:04) And then all of the countries who have been listening to you. Then the listening platforms (7:08) like we have Anchor, Apple Podcasts, web browser is what I'm using right now, Spotify and other (7:15) are like you know Radio FM and many other. Then the devices.
It shows you like people are (7:24) listening from web, iPhone, Android, Windows and other devices as well. It shows the gender of people (7:30) male, female, not specified, non-binary. And then we also have the ages of people.
And then the source (7:37) is always from Spotify but not for listening platforms because here Spotify itself comes (7:44) in a listening platform. So that's all about the podcast performance and how people are listening (7:51) to you. And then we can always go ahead and see the podcast availability if we come under the (7:59) settings option.
Under that you can see it automatically links to all the platforms. (8:07) So once you've uploaded the first episode on Anchor, it automatically links your podcast (8:13) on Spotify for free. And other platforms are Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Overcast, Amazon Music, (8:21) Castbox, Pocketcast, Radio Public and Stitcher.
So that's all that you need to know for today on (8:27) what exactly a podcast is and how does the Anchor setup looks like. In the next one we'll be learning (8:34) about how to make your podcast title description and what makes that catchy. So I hope you enjoyed (8:42) the video.
Thank you so much. Have a nice day.
     
Hello students, welcome to another video and here we will be starting with our new project. 
00:05
So I'm thinking of something like a student login application, just where people log in and just get the information they want. 
00:13
So we'll be working on a very simple app, much simpler actually, so let's just make it.
00:20
Login page first. 
00:21
So I have some ideas for the login page, so let's just get started.
00:27
I've imported a few images right here. 
00:29
This is for the background so.
00:33
Let me just adjust it here.
00:45
OK, hope it looks nice. 
00:46
I I should just.
00:52
Increase the size. 
00:53
OK, I think this looks fine now.
00:56
Let's constrain this important.
01:03
And there you go. 
01:04
Now let's import another image.
01:08
Initially I was just looking for a rectangle with rounded edges. 
01:11
I just couldn't find it so.
01:14
And I didn't wanna work hard to find that, so here we are with the regular rectangle anyways, so let's work with this.
01:29
I hope it looks fine. 
01:31
It looks fine, though. 
01:32
Yeah. 
01:32
So now we want some text to be entered. 
01:35
We'll be using this one right here, the third one.
01:40
And.
01:44
Let's give it a hint.
01:49
You're supposed to give it a hint, so it should be enter your username.
01:56
So I want the user to enter their username.
02:00
So it looks something like this, I think pretty OK, sufficiently OK, looks fine and.
02:09
Then we'll let's constrain this as well.
02:13
So we should constraint it here.
02:17
And the other one would go somewhere.
02:24
Here.
02:26
And we will move it a little up.
02:31
Did I mess up? 
02:33
No. 
02:34
OK.
02:37
I think it looks fine here. 
02:40
Now we'll copy this and paste it here itself. 
02:44
We have another one, we'll just adjust it a bit here. 
02:49
Here we will be using Enter.
02:53
Your.
02:55
Password.
02:58
So we have two.
03:01
Fields.
03:05
She just.
03:07
Yeah, and now we need the login button of course, so.
03:19
And the text would be different. 
03:21
Of course we want it to be.
03:24
I don't know what keys I pressed anyway, so.
03:29
OK text.
03:34
There we have it.
03:37
Login.
03:39
And we need to change The Color Purple.
03:44
Button here looks like we don't have any taste, no good taste. 
03:50
So we'll just change that. 
03:52
So changing it to black, for that you will be needing this background. 
03:58
We'll change the background to black.
04:02
I think it should be like 0.
04:05
If you wanted like pure black, the hashes would be this.
04:11
And there we have it. 
04:12
I think I'll just.
04:14
Increase the length.
04:18
OK.
04:21
I think our page looks fine now. 
04:23
You can also add the forgot password and all those things here, but we'll keep it simple for now. 
04:29
So this would be our GUI. 
04:31
We can also remove the borders, though I think I would.
04:40
It must be called outline I guess.
04:43
No, we'll have to change the style.
04:47
Probably. 
04:48
So let's change that. 
04:50
Not horizontally constrained, so let's just constrain that horizontally as well.
05:03
OK.
05:12
Now.
05:14
That's OK.
05:16
That wasn't, that wasn't really a border. 
05:18
It was simply like just because we have selected the element anyways. 
05:22
So we have some issues here. 
05:24
We'll sort those out first. 
05:26
It says content description for the image is missing. 
05:29
Yes, we need to add the image content description. 
05:32
You can. 
05:33
We'll just switch to a code and do it.
05:36
So.
05:39
Image we need to add the content description.
05:48
This one is the background image.
06:02
So I had it hardcoded already.
06:05
And then we made this Alice call it a rectangle just for the sake of.
06:12
What writing so?
06:24
It's hardcoded this as well.
06:29
Let's have a look at any other problems that we might have. 
06:33
The view isn't constrained the button, we have not constrained it yet, so let's do that as well. 
06:40
So you might forget a lot of things and then it will remind you that you didn't do that. 
06:46
So now.
06:49
Get it done.
06:51
OK.
06:53
Constrained.
06:55
Then we need to hard code a lot of strings.
06:59
Missing autofill.
07:02
Hints.
07:17
OK, we don't want to auto fill this though it will display those dots dots dots.
07:24
I mean, so we'll just let it go for now. 
07:27
We'll although we'll hardcode these strings here.
07:31
So let's just hard code these.
07:35
Yeah, we get it by now. 
07:36
We have done this a lot, so log in as well.
07:44
So there we go. 
07:45
I don't think we have many problems here.
07:48
So it says something is too small.
07:52
Fix it.
07:53
Change the height so it's just giving us suggestions that what could be wrong.
08:00
So we are just adjusting the size automatically. 
08:03
We'll just let it adjust.
08:06
So.
08:09
Um, color contrast. 
08:10
Well, we like it like that, so it's fine.
08:14
So yes, there will be a lot of suggestions that will get you where you can follow it or not. 
08:21
That's fine. 
08:21
Now this is our GUI, so that would be it for this video we made the GUI and in the next one we will be logging in and we'll be just checking the username and password that's entered by the user.
08:35
And act accordingly. 
08:36
So let's see.
  
Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56
    
Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page. 
00:05
A few things have changed since the last video. 
00:08
I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once. 
00:13
We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the.
00:20
Plaintext. 
00:20
So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one. 
00:25
So nothing new in that and then.
00:28
The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error. 
00:34
Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it. 
00:41
This is. 
00:42
These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own.
00:48
We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login. 
00:53
Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here. 
00:56
So we'll be.
00:59
I will be declaring these.
01:02
Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course. 
01:05
So then let's just do that.
01:13
This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
01:18
Password.
01:32
And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
01:37
Button. 
01:37
I call it importing, you can call it declaring. 
01:41
I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button.
01:48
Will declare that here as well.
01:51
We call it button simply.
01:55
And find view.
01:58
By ID.
02:00
And the ID is log in.
02:04
Button.
02:07
So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
02:16
On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username. 
02:24
So for that the if else would finally be used.
02:29
That we've learned previously in Java. 
02:32
So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
02:38
Username is.
02:41
What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
02:55
And then equals.
02:58
Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
03:07
It to be as and let's do the same. 
03:10
I'll just copy this one right here.
03:28
OK.
03:36
Let's just have.
03:39
These brackets separating them as well.
03:43
Just to keep it organized.
03:47
OK.
03:50
So now we'll be using this.
03:54
Widget here it's called toast, so it will be. 
03:58
You'll see it when you when we try and run it. 
04:03
So toast dot make text. 
04:05
Here goes the current activity we are on. 
04:09
We are on main activity dot this. 
04:12
As informed previously that would be the.
04:15
Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text. 
04:22
So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
04:28
Successful.
04:36
And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long. 
04:43
And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen. 
04:50
Similarly else.
04:53
Here we will be.
05:04
OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing. 
05:10
Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
05:16
Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
05:21
Or invalid, I'll just write them.
05:25
In valid.
05:31
Input.
05:34
Anything like that? 
05:36
OK, so that would be it. 
05:38
We declared all three variables here. 
05:41
This one is for username.
05:44
This one is.
05:46
For the password.
05:50
This one is the button.
05:56
This is the setting up the on click listener.
06:07
This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input. 
06:17
And let's get straight into testing our code. 
06:20
I think we are all set. 
06:23
So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.
   
Video and here we will be doing the back end coding of this login page. 
00:05
A few things have changed since the last video. 
00:08
I made a few changes to this one so I'll just go over it for once. 
00:13
We have changed the IDs, the username, I actually by mistake imported the password one we had to import the.
00:20
Plaintext. 
00:20
So I imported that and set it up just like the previous one. 
00:25
So nothing new in that and then.
00:28
The autofill has been set to null, so autofill hints right here as it was showing an error. 
00:34
Now this has been set up to blank as we do not want any autofills, so that would be it. 
00:41
This is. 
00:42
These are the few changes that I've made to the GUI, each one of them has their own.
00:48
We'll be using the last three three, the username, password and login. 
00:53
Let's move straight to the dot Java file right here. 
00:56
So we'll be.
00:59
I will be declaring these.
01:02
Usernames and passwords, because we'll be using them, of course. 
01:05
So then let's just do that.
01:13
This is for the username and let's do the same for the.
01:18
Password.
01:32
And the text view is done and now we need to import the.
01:37
Button. 
01:37
I call it importing, you can call it declaring. 
01:41
I just always think we are importing things anyways, never mind SO button.
01:48
Will declare that here as well.
01:51
We call it button simply.
01:55
And find view.
01:58
By ID.
02:00
And the ID is log in.
02:04
Button.
02:07
So now button and we'll set up the onclick listener here new.
02:16
On click listener setting it up, now we'll be authenticating it as in checking if the password and the username. 
02:24
So for that the if else would finally be used.
02:29
That we've learned previously in Java. 
02:32
So finally put your knowledge to use and now we'll be checking if the.
02:38
Username is.
02:41
What we wanted to be so for that one function that you will be using is dot get text that will help you to retrieve the text that the user has entered and then we will convert it to string.
02:55
And then equals.
02:58
Function would be used to compare it and here we'll enter any of the text that we want.
03:07
It to be as and let's do the same. 
03:10
I'll just copy this one right here.
03:28
OK.
03:36
Let's just have.
03:39
These brackets separating them as well.
03:43
Just to keep it organized.
03:47
OK.
03:50
So now we'll be using this.
03:54
Widget here it's called toast, so it will be. 
03:58
You'll see it when you when we try and run it. 
04:03
So toast dot make text. 
04:05
Here goes the current activity we are on. 
04:09
We are on main activity dot this. 
04:12
As informed previously that would be the.
04:15
Extension will be using and now make toast and here goes the text. 
04:22
So if it is equal then we'll say log in.
04:28
Successful.
04:36
And then let's just set up the length as well and set it up to long. 
04:43
And then most importantly you need to type in show that will show it on the screen. 
04:50
Similarly else.
04:53
Here we will be.
05:04
OK, so all right, so here we'll be doing a similar thing. 
05:10
Let's just copy paste this right here and in case.
05:16
Otherwise then we'll say it's unsuccessful.
05:21
Or invalid, I'll just write them.
05:25
In valid.
05:31
Input.
05:34
Anything like that? 
05:36
OK, so that would be it. 
05:38
We declared all three variables here. 
05:41
This one is for username.
05:44
This one is.
05:46
For the password.
05:50
This one is the button.
05:56
This is the setting up the on click listener.
06:07
This is where we check it and this is if it's test and test then it will show login successful otherwise it will show invalid input. 
06:17
And let's get straight into testing our code. 
06:20
I think we are all set. 
06:23
So let me switch to my phone and we'll see how this.

Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56
         
Students, welcome to another video and here we will be understanding what is an activity in Android Studios. 
00:06
We'll be seeing it in our Android Studio shortly, but before that, let's discuss what it is exactly. 
00:13
So it is just like a page. 
00:16
So you might have seen that we have different pages.
00:20
On each and every application that we come across, for example.
00:26
This taking example of Instagram. 
00:28
So we have a login page right here. 
00:32
It is one activity. 
00:34
Then we have another page right here. 
00:38
After you login into a page, after you enter your credentials here and you click on login.
00:46
It logs in and takes you to the home page. 
00:51
Here you have various options. 
00:53
You have some menus at the bottom which you can click. 
00:57
Here you have messages, so you can also click on stories. 
01:02
This is a main feed right here. 
01:05
So we have various elements.
01:07
To each and every page. 
01:09
Now how an Android application works is that. 
01:12
Just taking an example of this one itself, we have a login page of Instagram. 
01:17
It has various elements. 
01:19
You can see that it has looking at it from a developer's point of view, not a user's point of view. 
01:26
So.
01:27
So as a developer you would have a lot of things. 
01:32
Here we have a logo, here we have a language selector, we have login text boxes where they enter the text. 
01:41
Then we have a forgot your password? 
01:45
It is definitely a link.
01:47
A web link. 
01:48
Then similarly we have a login button. 
01:51
So now whenever you see this, what happens is how do we define it here? 
01:57
So when we have, whenever the user enters anything here credentials and clicks on the login page, the form is first validated, so it's checked.
02:07
Whether or not you have entered your ID and password in the correct format or not, and then later on the after the after it has checked that username and password is correct, it is directly linked to this page, your home page. 
02:26
So now that means that the.
02:28
Link Direct link between these two pages is this login button.
02:34
Similarly, let's have a look at this page right here. 
02:39
Now here we have various elements. 
02:42
That means. 
02:43
Well, that means that this is 1 activity. 
02:47
This is another activity, and.
02:50
Let's say one wants to open the messages. 
02:53
So whenever you open a message, there's a pop up, There's a new pop up here, either a pop up or a whole new different page with no elements of the previous page. 
03:05
So that is another activity. 
03:07
And that means that each and every element, each and every.
03:12
Place right in on the page is connected or is connected to a different activity. 
03:20
So that means that whenever I click on this, it will open my profile that is another activity. 
03:29
In this manner every element.
03:32
Is connected to an activity and these activities we have as we have various activities in app would be full of so many activities. 
03:41
It is just like a collection of activities. 
03:44
So that is what an activity is. 
03:47
You have to understand this. 
03:49
It is very important concept. 
03:51
We cannot move on until.
03:53
And unless this concept is clear of activity, take it as a page simply to move from one each and each and every element. 
04:02
If an element is functional, you click on it and anything opens. 
04:07
That means it is taking you from one activity to another. 
04:11
And to do so, what do we use?
04:14
Well, we used this thing mentioned right here, Intent. 
04:18
Intent is a class in Java that helps us to move from one activity to another. 
04:24
So we'll be using Intent and understanding it. 
04:27
In the next video, we'll be moving from one activity to another as well.
04:34
And later on, it will help us in our project. 
04:38
Understanding of this is very important again. 
04:42
So we'll do it practically here. 
04:44
Hope you've understood the theoretical point of view of the activity. 
04:49
So let's meet in the next video. 
04:52
Till then, make sure.
04:54
That these concepts are clear and let's move, OK?    
Since welcome to another video and here we will be understanding how to move from one activity to another and let's get started straight away. 
00:09
I have an empty activity. 
00:10
I removed the default hello world from here. 
00:13
So firstly the steps would be quite simple. 
00:16
Let me add a text here. 
00:18
So I'm just dragging and dropping a text.
00:22
And here I want to enter you are on the first activity.
00:32
So that will tell us the activity that we are on. 
00:36
Let me.
00:37
Adjusted somewhere in the middle. 
00:40
Let me just adjust it above it. 
00:44
OK, so let me constrain that as well and then.
00:52
I'll give it OK text view one. 
00:55
We will keep it as it is. 
00:58
Now I have added this. 
01:00
Then let's add another number, I mean another button and.
01:05
Without the text here.
01:08
Activity 2. 
01:09
So whenever I want to move to the activity 2, I would be clicking on this button right here. 
01:17
So we are all set. 
01:19
This is our first page activity. 
01:22
Let me just hard code this string right here.
01:29
And done.
01:32
We have another problem.
01:36
We need to constraint the button, yes. 
01:40
Let's constraint it as well. 
01:43
So done.
01:45
OK, so now.
01:49
We can copy these two as well.
01:52
I hope.
01:59
Copy OK, now let's define another activity. 
02:02
To do that just right click here next and then click on activity. 
02:07
You need to add a new activity. 
02:10
We will choose a an empty activity.
02:18
And it says.
02:23
OK, so now.
02:26
Let's.
02:28
So these two files right here are of activity two. 
02:31
Let me move the one that's for activity 1. 
02:34
So this is the GUI for activity 1 and this is the Java file. 
02:39
This is the activity for.
02:42
The second activity. 
02:43
So I've pasted everything here. 
02:46
Let me just.
02:48
OK.
02:50
Umm.
02:53
I think that was a bad idea. 
02:55
I should have done it from scratch anyhow, so.
03:00
Let's just keep it where these were so.
03:05
282 and 112.
03:20
So done with that.
03:23
Another button.
03:30
So whenever I want to move to Activity 1 back, I'll be using this.
03:37
Let me check constraints for this one as well.
03:41
So it says.
03:46
85 and 15.
04:12
You can constraint it like this as well, just like it was done so.
04:40
We'll call it 15.
04:44
OK, it's already 15. 
04:47
Nope, here. 
04:48
OK.
04:52
Done. 
04:53
So we are all set with the GUI for the.
04:58
First one we can see that we have ur on the first activity. 
05:03
For the second one let me just change it to you or on the second activity.
05:16
Let me hardcode that as well.
05:29
So we are done.
05:32
There's some warning here as well. 
05:35
Yes, let's hardcode this.
05:38
OK, so we are done. 
05:40
So we are done with the GUI. 
05:43
Now it's time to connect these to move from one activity to another. 
05:47
Every time the user clicks on this button right here, activity two, let me check the ID. 
05:54
It's simply button, so I'll copy it and now I'll declare the button right here.
06:00
Any time it's clicked, we'll be using the intent.
06:12
So let's.
06:22
Let's set the onclick listener.
06:29
And there you go. 
06:30
So here, now this part right here is very, very important. 
06:33
Now here we will be creating object of the Intent class. 
06:37
You can name it anything. 
06:38
Very, very important. 
06:39
Just pay attention. 
06:40
We have set up the onclick listener on the button. 
06:43
So now here what we'll be doing is first let's import it.
06:48
OK now we have created an object you can give it any name then new intent here this part. 
06:56
OK now here the first argument that goes into this one is the name of the current activity you are at. 
07:05
We are at main activity.
07:09
So this one goes here dot this. 
07:12
So the extension that we'll be using here is dot this then main activity .2 is the target and the extension that it will have is dot class. 
07:24
So intent create an object of that then.
07:29
In the intent goes to arguments. 
07:30
The first one would be the current activity main activity. 
07:34
The extension that you need to add is dot this and then in the second one would be the target, the extension would be dot class. 
07:42
Now simply all you need to do is start activity.
07:48
And then you will pass the object that you created. 
07:53
So that would be it. 
07:55
Simply this is the function. 
07:57
Let me copy the same.
08:01
And paste it in the.
08:04
Second one.
08:07
So we have. 
08:07
I hope we have the same ID.
08:11
No, it's called. 
08:12
Let me call it button.
08:16
OK, it already exists. 
08:18
There's some issue.
08:20
Leave it, we'll give it.
08:24
Button.
08:28
OK, so let's give it.
08:35
So the ID that we imported is BTN. 
08:39
Anyways other things would remain same except this part right here. 
08:43
Now our target is different and our current activity is actually the activity too. 
08:49
So the extension that would go here would be dot this and then.
08:55
This first activity is the target. 
08:58
So whenever the activity 2 button is clicked, it should move from activity. 
09:04
Sorry activity 1 button is clicked, it should go from activity 2 to activity 1. 
09:11
So let's just.
09:14
And that's the whole process. 
09:17
So we have created.
09:20
Two of these we have created.
09:24
2 interfaces 1 of activity 2 and one of activity one and then we connected it using the intent. 
09:31
So let's execute and see.
    
Students welcome again, and in this video we'll be understanding the onclick listener and what its usage is. 
00:07
Actually. 
00:07
Now we have this simple GUI right here. 
00:10
We have a text, it has an ID. 
00:13
Each one of these has an ID. 
00:16
So we have a background image. 
00:18
We won't be.
00:20
You know changing anything regarding that. 
00:22
We have a hide button, we have a page one text. 
00:26
The ID has been this. 
00:28
Now we'll be setting up the on click listener. 
00:31
It would work similar to onclick attribute.
00:35
Now this is an attribute. 
00:36
If I click on the problems it it says onclick method does not exist. 
00:41
Well it is used. 
00:42
We use it right right here it says that it is in the older versions of the platform. 
00:48
So this is 1 attribute that was previously used but we do not use it anymore. 
00:54
The reason being that.
00:55
It is no longer compatible, but it has not been discontinued till now. 
01:00
Because it is. 
01:01
It works for the older versions even here. 
01:04
We tried using it and it works very much fine. 
01:07
But we'll be using a more reliable method and a better method. 
01:12
It's called the onclick listener, so let's work with that.
01:15
And you should be using this method, the one that is displayed here, rather than using the onclick attribute. 
01:22
That was just to explain the attributes that come with each and every element of this GUI right here in the XML. 
01:30
Anyways, so we have this page. 
01:32
Let me just make another.
01:35
Let me make a few changes. 
01:36
Let me just select the hide button and here.
01:40
On click, I'll make sure it's empty. 
01:43
We do not have anything. 
01:45
OK, it's blank. 
01:46
I have erased anything that was here. 
01:49
This is the basic simple code. 
01:51
Let me just.
01:53
Change the text right here.
01:58
Let me just simply search for text.
02:05
Let's call it Click.
02:10
Me.
02:14
So this is the text.
02:17
We'll have to hardcode this as well.
02:20
Let's just hardcode it.
02:26
There you see it.
02:38
So we hard coded it now.
02:43
Let's add another button.
02:46
We'll just copy this one.
02:49
And paste it here itself.
02:52
Move it.
02:54
Up.
02:57
I hope I have put it in between the text. 
03:01
OK so we put two buttons right here and they are called click me.
03:07
Let me call it. 
03:09
Let me give these a different ID.
03:16
Top button.
03:20
This would be called the bottom button.
03:40
Now we'll be playing around with the with it a little bit here. 
03:45
OK, so now we have added two buttons. 
03:47
Here we have a text in between.
03:51
And now the real thing will start. 
03:53
So what we'll do is we'll declare all these three variables. 
03:57
We won't be touching the background now, we don't need it. 
04:00
Make sure each one of them has an ID.
04:04
So all of them have an ID. 
04:07
Let's declare these buttons both of them so.
04:12
Will be declaring it below here. 
04:14
You can also declare it here, but you make sure it's declared as public. 
04:18
I'll be declaring them locally here SO button.
04:23
I want to declare the.
04:26
Top button I'll give it the same name, no issues with that, but make sure that.
04:34
You use the. 
04:35
You consider the ID and the name. 
04:37
The variable name here as different. 
04:39
You can give it the same name, but they are different, so.
04:44
We are declaring the top button.
04:48
And now the main thing that we will be doing here is that we will.
04:55
Use the button top button dot set.
05:00
On click listener. 
05:01
Now this right here is very important. 
05:04
You need to.
05:06
Use this name right here and set onclick listener. 
05:10
What it will do. 
05:11
What it will do is that it will set up an onclick listener on that button. 
05:17
Whenever you click it, it will take an action. 
05:21
Then in the bracket you will write.
05:26
New view onclick listener and it will make an automatic function like this. 
05:31
Now here is where you need to type what should happen if this goes and this happens. 
05:37
So let me declare the text here as well.
05:49
Let me call it text equal to.
06:03
And there we have the text as well. 
06:07
Now whenever the top button is clicked, what I'll be doing is that I will set the text.
06:15
Dot.
06:17
Set.
06:19
Text.
06:34
OK, I was typing it wrong.
06:42
Type the set text.
06:46
Here the.
06:50
Top button was clicked.
06:55
So that would be the text that it would display.
07:00
Similarly, we'll do a similar thing with the other button right here. 
07:04
Let me just copy this.
07:07
And declare another one.
07:10
It should be called the bottom bottom.
07:16
And then let me change the ID here as well.
07:36
OK, there we have it. 
07:37
And we'll set up an onclick listener with that as well. 
07:40
We'll follow the same steps. 
07:42
Let me just type it for you.
07:46
So as you can see we have created a logic here. 
07:50
If this top button would be clicked then the texture texture change to the top button was clicked. 
07:57
If this button is clicked then bill it should display the bottom button was clicked. 
08:03
So that's it. 
08:04
Hope you understood how to set up the.
08:07
On click listener, we'll be just executing it right from here and you simply declare the variable and then set the onclick listener. 
08:17
Then just declare new.
08:20
View on click listener and it would automatically make.
08:25
A method for you and then you can just start with doing whatever you want to do after that button is clicked. 
08:31
You can add any kind of functions to this and now let's execute it.
08:56     
Students, welcome to another video. 
00:01
And here we'll be understanding how to make these buttons and any elements in the GUI functional. 
00:07
So it should do something when you click on a button. 
00:10
So what we want to do is we want this button to hide the background image whenever I click on it. 
00:17
So how do I do that well?
00:20
On this hide button and then.
00:23
It already has an ID. 
00:24
This background as well has an ID. 
00:27
So just click on the hide button right here and the attribute. 
00:30
You can always explore the attributes, but here the one that we are concerned with right now is called onclick. 
00:37
We'll be coming back to it in a bit. 
00:40
Now on click means that I will be defining a function.
00:44
And I'll put in the name of that function. 
00:46
Whenever the user clicks on this button, it will work according to what is defined in that function. 
00:52
And that function will be defined in the dot Java file. 
00:55
Now let's define a function to do the same, so public.
01:00
Void.
01:02
Let me give it a name, I'll just call it hide background.
01:09
Now, so this is the format that you need to follow. 
01:13
I'll be writing view and then view.
01:20
Now here what you need to do is alt enter. 
01:23
That is because you do not, you have not imported the package that was required. 
01:28
And similarly you will define a button here again it shows in red. 
01:32
That means we haven't imported the class. 
01:34
So alt enter button. 
01:35
You can give it any name, I'll just give it B.
01:39
Equal to.
01:42
Find view by ID.
01:49
R dot.
01:51
ID.
01:52
Dot DID.
01:56
So we have successfully gotten the button right here. 
01:59
So whenever actually you don't have to. 
02:02
I'm just telling you that if you want to import the button, in this case we do not need the button we want. 
02:10
We are concerned with the background image. 
02:13
So for that you'll be doing a similar thing image.
02:16
Menu.
02:20
Equal to.
02:29
I'll just give it a name image.
02:33
I think I misspelled it.
02:35
It's.
02:37
Image view. 
02:38
Yes it is image view.
02:41
OK, we have it imported anyways, so now find view.
02:45
You'll be using the same method right here R dot.
02:50
ID let me copy the ID from here.
02:58
It's this ID. 
03:00
I'll be typing it in here. 
03:03
dot DID.
03:07
Now what I want is this is how you import a button, how you import an image, how you import a text view as well anything. 
03:15
So let me just raise this one. 
03:17
We do need a button. 
03:18
Let me.
03:20
Take this off as well. 
03:22
So now whenever.
03:25
This button is clicked. 
03:28
I want it to.
03:31
Go to this.
03:34
Method right here, so I'll just type in here. 
03:37
Let me open a split window.
03:42
So you can also see it side by side on click.
03:50
So I'm giving it.
03:54
You can also choose it from the list.
03:56
So this right here.
04:01
Is hide background now image named it image. 
04:04
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a simple thing image dot set visibility.
04:14
And here I'm going to set it to invisible.
04:27
So I have set it to invisible image. 
04:30
I have imported the image, I've set it to image dot set visibility view invisible also you can also make it visible. 
04:38
I've made it invisible. 
04:40
So what it will do is.
04:43
Anytime we click on this button right here, it will search for this function and it will find it here. 
04:51
In this function we have defined the image view.
04:55
We have gotten it using the ID which is background image. 
04:59
I've named it image. 
05:00
Then I have used the same variable and set its visibility to invisible.
05:06
In that way, whenever I click on this button it will.
05:12
It will just simply hide the background. 
05:15
So let's just test it on my phone. 
05:17
I'll just run it and open it in my phone. 
05:21
Let's see.
05:24
OK, I connected my phone and let's run it and I'll be switching to my phone now.
    
Students, welcome to another video and here we will be doing the GUI. 
00:05
So we'll be understanding various parts of the GUI. 
00:09
Let's have a look at it. 
00:11
So a few elements that I want to introduce you to. 
00:15
This is a shortcut, I would say menu bar where you can.
00:20
We'll be using it in a while. 
00:23
So this is to hide or see the margins or the constraints. 
00:27
So and here we have a palette. 
00:30
Palette as in we have the common ones we can just drag and drop here, for example, let's just see this. 
00:37
So this is a button you can just.
00:40
Drag and drop it and just delete it for now. 
00:44
So you can delete it using the delete key from your keyboard. 
00:48
Just click on it and delete. 
00:50
And this is how we'll be doing it. 
00:53
You can also call it in a split window or the code window. 
00:58
So this right here, text view, this portion right here.
01:02
Is for this hello world text right here it shows the layout width and the height. 
01:07
So wrap content as in. 
01:09
If the content is more it would stretch out a little bit. 
01:13
If we increase the size of the text it would increase the height so it will be the wrapping the content.
01:21
And then Android text is equal to hello world. 
01:24
So we have a text here. 
01:26
If you want to change it, say I want to change it to.
01:31
I'll just change it to element.
01:37
So then you can see it has changed the text to the element. 
01:41
And then we have these 4 constraints. 
01:43
We'll be understanding those in detail right here. 
01:46
So let's just switch to the design.
01:49
Mode you can see we have a constraint layout here. 
01:53
What do we mean by constraint layout? 
01:55
So if you click on this element you can see these spring like structures on all four sides. 
02:02
So these are called constraints. 
02:04
You can simply take them as springs. 
02:06
So it is just like a spring so.
02:09
Let me just remove all these constraints. 
02:11
You can just clear it from here. 
02:14
Yes, so it says clear all constraints. 
02:16
It's also showing me a warning that it lacks constraints. 
02:19
If I click here, I can see so no. 
02:22
It's for the hardcoded text anyways, so you need constraints. 
02:25
Why do we need constraints? 
02:27
I'll be explaining it in a bit.
02:30
But before that.
02:32
Let's see how to add constraints so you can simply.
02:36
Uh, click on the circle right here and give it a horizontal top constraint and the bottom one. 
02:43
I'll just show it in a split window right here so you can see.
02:49
It has a top constraint.
02:52
Let me just add another one.
02:54
So you can see it keeps on adding the constraints.
02:58
And this One South due to this, what happens is you can see it's at the bottom of the parent.
03:06
Everywhere it mentions the parent here parent means the full screen right here. 
03:10
So if I click on it, what happens is that it will be in the middle of the parent and the bottom, parents top and the parents bottom which is right here. 
03:22
So this is how constraints work. 
03:25
Let's see why.
03:26
Do we need constraints? 
03:27
So what if I do not have a constraint? 
03:31
I just let me just remove all these constraints here. 
03:35
What will happen is that this element right here can appear in different places on the screen. 
03:42
So that would be a problem as you know that we keep.
03:47
As you know we an application is not run in a single kind of screen size. 
03:54
So anytime anything changes, the screen size changes. 
03:57
It has to adjust, it has to be responsive. 
04:01
So let's say if the screen size is smaller, the elements should actually adjust themselves.
04:07
Accordingly. 
04:08
So that is why we use constraints. 
04:11
Let me just drag another text view element.
04:15
Let's just call this element one. 
04:17
I'll call this element 2 to change it. 
04:20
What you will be doing is you can simply click on it and here you have this attributes tab. 
04:26
It works similar to the way that the code works. 
04:29
You can also make all these changes in the code so you can also see the constraint.
04:35
Layout here. 
04:36
Here it says plus, so we do not have any constraints added. 
04:40
I'll just delete it anyways. 
04:42
So let me name this element one. 
04:45
I'll just call it element 1.
04:48
And.
04:50
I'll call this.
04:52
Element 2 I'm just changing the text.
04:57
So these are the two elements right here.
05:01
Let me just.
05:04
Let me just change the height and width to wrap content.
05:10
OK, so there we have element 1 and element 2. 
05:13
As you can see, they do not have any constraints. 
05:16
You can just click on it and you'll see no constraints.
05:20
Now here what I'll be doing Well let's say this is a text and this is some button. 
05:28
We are we have it on our login screen let's say. 
05:32
So I always want the element to below the element 1 so.
05:38
What I'll be doing is let me just give it a.
05:43
Horizontal constraint and let me give this one a horizontal constraint as well. 
05:48
Now what I'm doing here.
05:52
So I'll give it a bottom constraint as well.
05:56
There you go, I'm giving it.
06:01
A top constraint.
06:05
OK.
06:07
Yes, no. 
06:08
OK, Now what I'm doing is I'll just tie both these here.
06:15
Sorry.
06:17
I'll just tie the element 2 to element one with the constraint.
06:24
OK. 
06:25
And there you go.
06:27
OK Oh my God, it's so.
06:30
Yes.
06:33
Let me just.
06:36
It's not that hard though. 
06:38
OK, so now with that, what happens is you can see element one right here. 
06:44
It does not have a bottom constraint. 
06:47
Element 2 has all the constraints and you can see that element 2 is tied up between the element 1 and element.
06:56
So it will always be in between.
07:01
It will always be in between the element 1 and element 2. 
07:06
So it doesn't matter if we change the screen size changes or anything, the orientation or the relative position of these elements remain. 
07:16
So element 2 would always be in the middle of the element 1 and.
07:22
Hit bottom as you can see.
07:25
The bottom constraint, the bottom of text view 2 is the top constraint of element 2. 
07:31
So this is how it works. 
07:33
So This is why we use elements so that we can relate.
07:40
Keep a check on the relative position of all the elements even if the size or anything like that changes. 
07:47
So that would be it for now. 
07:50
This is what we mean by constraint layout. 
07:53
You have other options right here Constraint layout, then we have linear layout. 
07:57
You could use multiple layouts otherwise but.
08:00
If you are using the constraint layout then it would remove all other layouts that are used as sub layouts. 
08:07
So we cannot use multiple layouts there. 
08:10
If you are using constraint layout it will be the only one layout that is being used so that would be it for the layout. 
08:18
You don't have to understand the other ones.
08:21
The constraint layout is a very good layout and it works well with everything. 
08:27
So that is the one that we'll be using here and let's meet in the next video. 
08:33
We'll be understanding a few more things about the GUI.    
Welcome to another video and here we will be understanding a few more elements of the GUI. 
00:06
So let's start with importing an image. 
00:09
So what if I want a background image right here? 
00:13
So let me just delete this one right here. 
00:16
And I want an image, so just let me.
00:21
Let me find image view is the element that we use. 
00:25
Now once I drag and drop here I can see this. 
00:30
There are some predefined ones right here. 
00:33
I want to import an image. 
00:36
So let's click on this plus icon and import drawables.
00:43
And here we can import any image we want to. 
00:47
Let me just find one that's on the desktop.
00:57
I have a few here as well, let me just import one for you.
01:06
So I have this one right here. 
01:09
Just click on next.
01:11
Import.
01:14
And there you can see that we have this image right here.
01:19
This so now if I try drag and drop I can find this picture.
01:27
And I can put it here.
01:32
As the background. 
01:33
So this is how you import any image you want to use as a background. 
01:39
Let me let me get a little bit of a neutral background right here so I had one open right here. 
01:47
Just let me just reload it so well, whenever you use any image, make sure.
01:52
It's simple, simply royalty free so you can just use it.
02:00
Never use images that belong to somebody else while you were doing a project. 
02:05
Keep this in practice. 
02:06
Let me just find a little bit of a neutral 1. 
02:10
I think this one's OK. 
02:11
This one seems fine.
02:15
And let's download it. 
02:16
I'll just put it in that folder itself.
02:21
I think I had one right here.
02:24
It's the same one I downloaded previously as well anyways, so here I'll just paste this one. 
02:30
Let me just name it.
02:33
New.
02:35
Background. 
02:35
I'll just give it a random name and save it.
02:40
Let me just close this one.
02:46
OK, let me delete it. 
02:48
You can also paste it here. 
02:51
Simply you can drag and paste it in this drawables folder. 
02:56
You can locate it resources and then open the drawable. 
03:00
Here you can just simply drag and drop.
03:04
I'll just import it like I did previously so.
03:09
Import drawables from the same one. 
03:12
It hasn't updated it. 
03:13
OK it has. 
03:15
There you go. 
03:16
New background and both make sure it's not too much.
03:22
High in quality. 
03:24
Sometimes it rejects it as well, so that might be sometimes an issue. 
03:30
So I have it here. 
03:32
OK, use it.
03:39
Adjust it here. 
03:41
OK, hold on.
03:45
Let me just.
03:47
Make it a bit bigger.
03:49
I don't think I chose a very nice background, but just for, just for, you know, practice, we'll be using a better one when we do the project. 
04:00
OK, so now here it shows me a problem. 
04:04
Let's see what the problem is. 
04:06
It's missing constraints. 
04:07
Let's put the constraints here.
04:09
Then.
04:16
You can only use. 
04:18
Probably you can only use the horizontal constraints, that is also fine. 
04:23
And now I'll just give it an ID, so that is how it will be recognized background.
04:32
Image.
04:34
Now let's make it a bit responsive as in responsive I mean something should happen when I let me just give it a smaller name BG ID, I mean BG image. 
04:48
OK so now.
04:51
This ID is definitely important.
04:57
We have adjusted the background here.
05:00
So this is how you will be importing an image. 
05:03
We'll just add a button here and then we'll finish off. 
05:06
We'll do the rest in the next video S Let's just add a button here. 
05:11
I'll add. 
05:12
I'll drag a button here.
05:21
OK, now.
05:29
OK, there you go, finally. 
05:30
So, so just click on it. 
05:33
I'll open the attributes right here.
05:36
So I'll just give it a name.
05:40
I mean a name as in the text, so I'll call it hide.
05:47
And we need to give it constraints as well. 
05:50
Again, it says constraints are missing, so you can just simply click on this button now. 
05:55
It says hard coded string anyway, you don't have to worry about it, it's just a warning. 
06:01
We'll fix it though, so I'm just naming it hide.
06:05
Let me just drag it to the middle of the screen. 
06:10
Now what I wanna do is.
06:13
I'm I'm making it a very simple 1 so I'm going to do one thing here. 
06:18
I want to hide this background. 
06:21
I just want this background to vanish whenever I click on this button. 
06:25
So I want it to be responsive. 
06:27
Let's see how to do it in the next video we have made the GUI.
06:33
For this and we'll see how to do it in two different ways. 
06:37
One that's a little bit outdated, it was used previously. 
06:41
Another one would be the one that is used nowadays, the one that works with each and every application. 
06:47
I will have a look on both the methods and let's meet in the next video.
    
Welcome to another course here. 
00:02
The course is known as Application Development Using Android Studio. 
00:07
So we'll be developing a mobile application or basically learning how to develop a mobile application using Android Studio. 
00:15
The language that we'll be employing here would be.
00:20
Java. 
00:20
So let's just start with the introduction of what Java is. 
00:24
Although you should previously have read about Java, and you should know certain basic concepts of Java before you dive into this one. 
00:33
So just for the introduction sake, we'll discuss what Java is. 
00:38
Well, Java is an object.
00:40
Blended programming language. 
00:41
It is employed at various projects like Android application development and web-based applications, mobile games and so on. 
00:50
Android application development is what we'd be doing today or we'll be learning about it today and Android Studio.
01:00
So what is Android Studio? 
01:02
Well, it is an IDE. 
01:05
IDE basically integrated development environment. 
01:07
It is a software where you can program an Android application and run it, test it, develop it. 
01:16
Simply speaking, now the languages that are employed.
01:20
For this purpose could be Java, C, Kotlin. 
01:24
Android Studio supports all three of them. 
01:27
Java and C were previously supported and later on Kotlin was added as well. 
01:33
Java is the most preferred language to make Android studios and the second one would be.
01:41
Portland second one second most preferred 1 S that is about Java and Android studios. 
01:48
Now before we dive into this course, you Start learning new things In this course you will require some basic prior knowledge about Java before we actually Start learning.
02:01
Or coding actually. 
02:02
So in this one what you will require is you would need to know what objects and classes are in Java, how to define them. 
02:11
Now I have made a checklist for you. 
02:14
You can take a screenshot, you can just pause it. 
02:17
Right here. 
02:18
You can learn about each and every concept individually.
02:21
Or you can take up another course. 
02:24
If you do not know all these things you can take apart another course that's called Basics of Java. 
02:30
So that would work for you as well. 
02:33
Now the concept that you need to know need to know are objects in classes. 
02:37
Then you would require to know variables and constants, how to declare variables.
02:42
4th 1 would be data types and conversions. 
02:45
You must know data types such as you should know int, float, double.
02:51
Uh, character string. 
02:52
So all these data types must be known to you. 
02:55
How to convert from one data type to another is also very often employed here, so you must know that as well. 
03:02
Later on you would know operators. 
03:04
Very basic concept of each and every language. 
03:07
You should know what operators can be used in Java.
03:11
Then another concept, control statements. 
03:13
Now these control statements are definitely very important while you are coding because that would decide the flow of your program. 
03:23
So anything that we want to do, any decision making that we will be doing would be done through these.
03:32
Now uh conditional statements if else statements if else, if nested if switch case would be required then the other concept loops loop 3 loop that would be for loop, while loop and do while loop those would be required jump statements these can be.
03:52
Kept is optional. 
03:53
You can learn about these or not because generally jump statements are not considered very. 
04:00
They work though, but they're not very considered considered very reliable. 
04:05
So the two statements that jump statements would be break statement and continue statements then.
04:12
Very important concept. 
04:13
Functions. 
04:13
So you need to be very thorough with the functions or methods. 
04:17
Same thing. 
04:18
So functions. 
04:19
You need to know how to define a function. 
04:22
You must know how to call a function by value as well as reference later on. 
04:27
Last second you should know how to work with strings, how to declare a string.
04:33
And just know a few basic predefined functions that are already there in Java to work with strings and how to use them. 
04:42
Last but not least, packages you must know you for now, as this course is a bit basic, you would not really require to know how to define new packages.
04:54
But you would definitely need to know how to use the ones that are already available. 
05:00
So importing packages, how to import them, how to use them must be known to you. 
05:07
Because sometimes we are using certain concepts in our development while we are coding and it does not really recognize it.
05:16
That's when the package being imported is missing. 
05:18
So one must know how to import and pack a package as well. 
05:23
So these are the concepts that would be required.
05:27
Now, the things that we learned here is that what Java is, what Android studios are, and what would be the prerequisite knowledge about Java that you require before starting this course. 
05:41
So get prepared and in the next video we'll be learning how to.
05:47
Install Android Studios.  
   
Hey guys. 
00:03
So as we were talking about our brand sensor as a.
00:08
Project for this course I decided it would be a good idea to show you guys a working model of the code.
00:18
Now as you can see it's a lot of code but.
00:23
I will walk you through it and you will understand that it's not really as complicated.
00:28
So first thing you see is I have installed and liquid crystal display which is the LCD display module.
00:37
I have included its library in it.
00:41
And these are all the sensors that we're using.
00:45
So we have ADHD, which is a temperature humidity sensor, a photo resistor, a soil moisture sensor, a raindrop sensor, which is a rain sensor, as I've mentioned earlier, and a buzzer. 
00:55
So buzzer is basically like a bell. 
00:57
So if you send it a high signal, it's just creates a sound.
01:03
And these are all our variables for it and we have an alert message.
01:10
Now in setup we are initializing all our pins, LCD display and serial monitor.
01:18
In this section.
01:22
This is for our.
01:24
RDC display or RTC module.
01:28
So this is actually from a library. 
01:31
I haven't really created it, but what this essentially does is it makes sure that we are connected to an RTC library and we are connected to the RTC module and it's getting the correct time.
01:48
Now the first section is I'm getting every value that we need.
01:54
So the temperature humidity is soil moisture, the moisture present in the soil. 
02:00
So that is actually being correct collected from here. 
02:04
So the soil moisture actually gives you an analog value which is zero to 1023.
02:11
But in this case.
02:15
We need it in a percent.
02:20
And in soil moisture sensor, the higher the value, the lower the moisture. 
02:25
So 1023 is the driest and I'm converting it into a percent. 
02:29
So 0 will be the driest. 
02:31
And this is a map function. 
02:34
So this is what we use to convert from 1 range to the other. 
02:39
So here we're converting the.
02:40
Video of soil Reed.
02:43
2 From 1023 to 02 the range from zero to 100.
02:50
And this is photo read. 
02:52
This is the value that we are reading from the photoresistor, which I've explained is simple.
02:58
Sensor which tells us the higher the value, the higher the intensity of light. 
03:02
It just tells you if it's bright or not.
03:06
And again, I'm doing the same thing with that. 
03:09
I'm just converting the light, the photo resistor value into a percent. 
03:14
So I'm converting essentially everything from zero to 100 so it's easier to read and understand.
03:21
And this is the rain. 
03:23
So rain is actually a little weird. 
03:25
It gives you low when it's raining and high when it's dry, even though it's called a rain sensor, which should be like an opposite trend. 
03:34
So here I'm just converting its value to the other way so it says hi when it's raining.
03:42
Not this again.
03:44
Is the a disc module? 
03:46
It's just giving you what time and date it is right now.
03:51
And I'm displaying everything in LCD this way, so I'm calling a function.
03:55
Again, as I said, functions are really easy to display stuff that's repeated again and again.
04:00
So it is displaying every detail that we have from the sensor on the display and that the next function that I have is.
04:10
Serial display and it is doing the same thing on a serial display. 
04:14
Serial monitor. 
04:15
Here I have checked sensors.
04:18
Now check sensors is a function which is checking.
04:23
If every value is in the range that we need.
04:28
Like I said, first thing it is striking is the temperature. 
04:32
If the temperature is what we need, if the temperature is too high or too low, and if it's too high or too low, we are adding or creating an alert message and we are displaying it.
04:47
On the serial monitor as well as on the LCD display.
04:53
Then we are checking humidity if it's too humid or if it's if the air is too dry.
05:00
And we're displaying the required message then it is slight incident intensity. 
05:06
Same thing we are checking for photopheresis, photoresistors value. 
05:09
But here we are checking it with time because if it is night then photo resistors value will be very low and we don't know that.
05:21
We cannot fix it at night, it has to be dark. 
05:24
So here we are checking if the time is too early.
05:28
Or if the if it's like midnight, we're not checking the time and if it's like midday then we are checking if it's too light.
05:36
So we're not checking the intensity of light at night.
05:42
The next comes moisture present.
05:45
And this is to see how much moisture there is in soil. 
05:49
So it's like soil is wet, which means the soil needs to be trained. 
05:53
Here it says soil is dry.
05:55
So I need some moisture and here if you see every warning statement has a buzzer high and low with it.
06:04
This means every time there's something that's not right, the buzzer will ring so person can know that I have to go and check the messages to know what's happening.
06:14
The next is rain and this is the last one and the rain values if it's raining.
06:21
We need to cover the plant so there's not too much watering happening.
06:27
We displayed on serial and on the LCD. 
06:29
Because we have limited space. 
06:31
We just write training. 
06:32
We hit the buzzer, after 2 seconds we turn it off.
06:37
So it's not ringing all the time, but it's just enough so people can go and check, like what's happening and why is it ringing?
06:45
So if it's ringing and I go there, it's it's raining, I know like ohh I have to cover it. 
06:50
And in case I don't know what to do with it, I go on my serial monitor says cover the plant and I'm like OK, so I should cover it to avoid that it doesn't get overwatered.
07:00
But anyways, that's the conclusion of this course and hope you enjoyed it with me.
07:06
And hope you liked it as much as I did, so until next time, have a good time.
     
Hey guys, welcome back. 
00:05
So this time we're working on a keypad. 
00:08
Now a keypad is a simple Arduino.
00:13
Component which is basically 4x4 grid of buttons.
00:19
And it is essentially an input device because it has buttons that you can press to send different values.
00:26
Kind of like a keyboard.
00:28
Just with the numbers and very limited characters.
00:32
Now, if you go to your Tinkercad, your Tinkercad actually has a keypad and this is how usually the keypad look. 
00:39
Just to let you know if you ever worked with one physically, you have to be very careful and gentle with this because this component of it is very fragile. 
00:48
So I suggest you take very good care of it.
00:52
Is if you snap it or fold it in half, you will never be able to work it again because that essentially breaks it.
01:00
Now as you can see, our keypad has one through 0 in digits, it has hash and a bound and it has ABCD.
01:13
And it has 8 pins.
01:18
Now it's very simple. 
01:19
We connect all of them to our Adreno directly.
01:24
But the complicated part in keypad is not the wiring. 
01:27
It's pretty simple, it's decoding.
01:30
So.
01:33
If I'm to explain it to you how it is connected.
01:38
With these green four and the red 4 cables, they form a grid.
01:45
So these are four of them are columns and four of them are rows.
01:52
Their individual columns. 
01:53
So one is connected to 1/2, is connected to 2-3, is connected to three, and vice versa.
02:04
I will change the numbers so first four are the wires, now that's 13 to 10.
02:16
And then the second floor or the red ones are Geo columns.
02:21
So here I will put them as.
02:30
No, to work with the keypad, there's a keypad library key, capital, everything else is small letter. 
02:36
You include that library and you create a constant variable. 
02:39
Now constant variable is something that is constant, so something that.
02:44
Does not have a changing value and it is keyword byte.
02:50
We have 4 rows and four columns. 
02:52
So we have a rows variable 4 and a column is variable 4.
02:57
Now we are creating a character array now 2D array so it has a column and row. 
03:02
In this case we have 4 column four rows. 
03:05
We have already defined those and we are calling this array as KP array.
03:11
Now here.
03:13
And you're basically programming how it looks like.
03:18
So.
03:19
This is the first row. 
03:21
It is in curly braces.
03:23
This is the second row in curly braces. 
03:26
Again this is a character array so it all everything is in single quotation marks as it is a character.
03:35
You can also change it around if you want like a different pattern. 
03:38
If you're looking for some different characters, you can replace it.
03:43
But for now we are going with the standard display, so we are following the same display than the original.
03:51
Keep that house.
03:53
Nothing fancy.
03:56
Now you create a variable of Keypad class. 
03:59
We are calling it keypad here. 
04:02
So you go keypad make a key map. 
04:06
So you make a key map using that array.
04:11
Now row pins.
04:14
I told you these are the pins.
04:17
And.
04:18
We are creating a smaller like A1 dimensional area for all the pins as well. 
04:23
So it is the area of rows array of pins.
04:28
The number of rows and number of pin columns.
04:36
And.
04:37
In order to get the input from a user you use keypad get key K capital. 
04:43
Now the get key will give you the value that is pressed and it will tell you the value based on the values that you entered.
04:55
So if you press, say D.
04:59
First column.
05:01
1st row.
05:04
So that is 1 and here it is first column, first row the value is 1.
05:10
It will see that OK, it's the first set, first column, first row.
05:16
So we have breast.
05:19
13 and 9 so the conjunction of the wire 13 and 9 is at #1 so it says OK it's 13 and 9:00 so that is the first and 1st so 13 and 9 combine it #1 so it will say OK so this one value is number 1 and we storing it in.
05:39
Press button.
05:42
And now and then if we have a press button value we are just displaying it.
05:47
So here we are not actually waiting for it, we are just like constantly getting an input and as soon as we get an input for press button.
05:56
We are displaying it now. 
05:58
Let's start a simulation.
06:00
And I'll open the serial monitor.
06:04
It's this one and the first one. 
06:08
Let's press D1D.
06:11
945-B.
06:17
Now Keeper is a really fun thing to use, especially. 
06:20
The most prominent example I can see is a passcode machine. 
06:24
So if you ever pay something with your card, you have a keypad that you enter your PIN on.
06:32
And that is pretty much the same thing that we're doing here.
06:35
So you if you want to like help make some fun projects using a keypad, you can create a project like an intruder alarm where someone has to enter a password to open the door and if they enter a wrong password multiple times.
06:52
Or you send an emergency e-mail. 
06:53
Or you send a call to someone.
06:58
Or you can just like play a calculation game so you can give someone 5 into 3 and they have to enter the answer so they will press 1 and 5.
07:08
And you can convert the D.
07:11
Key to enter. 
07:12
So whenever they press that button, it enters their value. 
07:15
So if they have entered 15 and they press T, that means they're giving like, yeah, that's my answer. 
07:22
Or you can do a multiple choice ABCD. 
07:24
They press different choices can you can have a number of things that you can do with it. 
07:30
You can.
07:31
Just have fun with it.
07:33
It's always best to experiment, especially without. 
07:35
We know the more you play with it, the more you learn. 
07:39
So that's it for today and have some fun with it.
  
Hey guys, welcome back. 
00:04
So in the previous videos we saw how we can use digital and analog pins, how they are different and we saw how to use loops. 
00:13
So for this video, I think it's best that we start with if or the conditional approach, so to demonstrate that.
00:23
Use a push button.
00:26
The LED structure is the same, but for this one I will connect it to the digital pin again.
00:35
And I will use #7.
00:40
And for the push button.
00:43
As you can see it has four pins and you will also find some that has 2 pins, but for Tinkercad we have the one that has four pins on it so we are only going to use two of them.
00:57
So one of these will be connected to the positive terminal.
01:01
Now this is slightly different than LED's, because for this we only need.
01:07
The signal to reach the Arduino when it's fully connected or when it's.
01:15
Properly working when pressed.
01:19
Basically so it will only reach the current from from the button will only reach the Arduino at pin number 2 when it is pressed. 
01:28
So that is when the circuit will be complete and it will be running.
01:34
No, like just like LED, we are also going to use a resistor for this one. 
01:39
But for the push button, the resistor's value is slightly different. 
01:43
Instead of 330 ohm, we are using 10K ohms.
01:49
I'm gonna turn it here.
01:52
And connect this one to the negative terminal.
01:58
Positive and negative completes the circle, so completes the circuit and this yellow wire is what is what's connecting to the.
02:08
Arduino. 
02:08
So that's what is giving the signal to Arduino if it's turned on or off. 
02:14
So how this works it whenever the button is pressed, the circuit is complete. 
02:19
That means current starts flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.
02:25
What that means when the current when the button is not pressed, there's no current passing through the yellow wire, so there's no current reaching the pin number 2, so pin number 2 has nothing coming in it. 
02:37
But when the button is pressed, the positive current will flow to the pin number 2, so the Arduino is able to read if it's getting some.
02:48
So if it receives some current on that pin that means it has a high value and that means it's on. 
02:54
But if it is not receiving any value that means it is off. 
02:57
So when the button is pressed it will say I have a high value so the button is pressed.
03:04
OK, so let's start programming it.
03:09
For this one I want to show you how we do this by First we need to fix the pen mode for the LED. 
03:17
Again, we know it's now pin number 7 and that's for output pictures.
03:23
Does not give you any value back to the Arduino, it only takes the command, but for the button it's the reverse. 
03:30
So button is telling something to add, you know, so it will be.
03:37
So we are going to use spring pin mode pin number two. 
03:41
It's supposed to take input, so it's supposed to read what the Arduino or the what the button is telling it.
03:51
So I will do a really simple code here. 
03:55
So if the button says that it's high.
03:59
Or that it's pressed. 
04:01
The LED should turn on now. 
04:03
How do you know if the button is pressed or if the signal is high now? 
04:08
Like it is still right? 
04:10
It's supposed to tell a digital signal. 
04:13
Digital read will tell help you read a digital signal.
04:17
So digital read, what are we reading? 
04:20
We are reading pin number 2, so we are constantly checking if pin number 2 has a value coming to it. 
04:27
If the pin number 2 has a high value that means the circuit is complete, which only happens when the button is pressed. 
04:34
So that means the button is pressed.
04:44
Now if the button is pressed, what do we want to do?
04:48
We want to make sure the LED is on again. 
04:51
We have done this a couple Times Now.
04:54
So we turned it on by doing digital right.
05:00
At the pin number 7, because that's where the pin, that's where the LED is and turn it high.
05:08
Now we can turn it off at the same time, but for me I prefer having a small delay of at least 500 that's half a second so we can actually see the transition.
05:22
Let's start.
05:28
I missed the bracketeer.
05:30
And noticed.
05:32
OK.
05:34
So if you see nothing is happening because button the circuit is not closed. 
05:39
But once I press it, the circuit should complete and the LED should turn on. 
05:44
Press it, LED is on. 
05:46
But now when I leave it, it is not turning off. 
05:50
Why? 
05:51
Because we have nothing that's turning it off so.
05:54
Once it is on.
05:56
It is staying on no matter what, right?
06:00
So I will stop the simulation and I will put a else condition here.
06:07
So if the button is pressed, we are turning it on, but if the button is not pressed we make sure that it is turned off.
06:23
Again, make sure your keywords like input, output, high and low are all in capitals and even the words the keywords like pin mode, digital read, digital write, they have the correct cap so they have the correct capital letter on SM.
06:42
A bit more should be capital W in digital, right? 
06:45
Digital read, R should be capital, analog write and we should be capital and same goes for other keywords that we will use along the way.
06:55
Because if one of them is not written correctly, one of them is in the correct capital state, it will not work and it will throw an error like it did for a missing bracket.
07:06
OK, now it should turn off whenever the button is not pressed.
07:12
So right now nothing is pressed so it is off. 
07:16
Once I press the button it turns on. 
07:18
Now when I leave it, this digital read signal will is no longer high so it will jump to the else clause and it will go digital right low.
07:30
I left it and eventually went off. 
07:32
Now when I press it, it's on again. 
07:34
Then I'll leave it it's off.
07:41
Now it is simple enough and after this we will start jumping into a bit more complex part of it. 
07:48
So it will start getting complicated and it will.
07:52
Pick up the speed because now we have covered some of the basics and we will start speeding it up.
08:00
So for this one what I want you to try doing is add a multiple LED's and make sure they work have different combinations. 
08:09
You can also try putting 2 buttons together so if both the buttons are pressed LED should turn on. 
08:15
If one button is pressed nothing should happen. 
08:18
To do that you can try.
08:20
Putting them in series.
08:23
So if two buttons are connected together and they only have one, or they only have a common wire that's connecting it to the Arduino, it should work easily. 
08:37
So everything should be same. 
08:40
I'm just adding another button here.
08:44
Like there's another button here.
08:50
And it it has its own complete circuit, but it should work interconnectivity. 
08:55
So when 1 is on, the other is on, only then the LED should turn on. 
09:00
Or you can add multiple LEDs and play with it and figure out how things work. 
09:06
Because as as much as you mess with the Arduino on especially.
09:11
You can experiment different ways and find out how things work better. 
09:16
It's all on practice, so keep practicing and we'll see you 
    
Hey, welcome back guys. 
00:04
One last lecture, I showed you how we can turn an LED on and off using digital, right?
00:11
But that's how you use digital pins, right? 
00:15
Digital pin have an on and off, a high and a low signal. 
00:20
But then what does analog mean now? 
00:23
Like digital has on and off, like computers, it has zero and one. 
00:28
Analog actually has a range of values.
00:31
It can go from zero to 1000 and it can go from zero to 255 and values like that, and it pretty much depends on what device you're working with.
00:43
So let's see how that works with an LED. 
00:46
Now in LED, one thing that I know for sure is the values go from zero to 255.
00:52
So that is the range we work in when we are using LEDs 0 to 255, how we will use it or how it is implemented. 
01:01
So to start with that first, instead of connecting to a digital pin like #7, we will connect it to an analog pin.
01:10
See number 80.
01:14
I can change its color to.
01:18
Bank so you have you can easily see the difference how it's working.
01:25
Alright, that's not too visible, so let's go for a yellow.
01:40
Now the code pretty much remains the same. 
01:44
We don't change the code much, the only thing we change is the digital right.
01:52
Statement changes. 
01:53
So how does the right statement changes now? 
01:56
Digital, right in the name itself, it means we are writing or we are giving a digital signal or a digital command. 
02:04
So we will change that to analog, right?
02:09
Now what does analog write do? 
02:11
It is used to send an analog command.
02:14
So we are sending an analogue right to pin 7.
02:19
And we will send it to 2255.
02:23
No for LEDs.
02:27
255 means high. 
02:28
That means.
02:31
For the brightness.
02:34
OK.
02:36
And the zero which is the other extreme of the range means low.
02:43
That means.
02:45
Totally off.
02:50
So any value in between?
02:54
Will actually be the level of brightness. 
02:57
So 0 being the lowest brightness and 255 being the highest brightness. 
03:02
So if you say a number like 125, that will be kind of like a medium brightness on the LED.
03:12
Again, the the brightness or level of brightness will vary based on the number.
03:18
So if I say I'm doing analog right on this.
03:23
Now the pain is no longer 7, it is a 0. 
03:27
So I will change it to a zero both here and pin mode just so our Arduino knows which pin we are working with and I will give it a analog write signal of 255. 
03:40
That means analog write of.
03:43
Full brightness and here I will give it an analog signal.
03:51
Of zero, that means it should turn completely on, stay on for one second, and then convert completely off and stay off for one second. 
04:00
Pretty much the same thing we did in our previous video.
04:16
Now the one thing that happened was I did not change it so it could not execute properly. 
04:21
So let's start.
04:32
Knows it's turning on for one second and turning off for one second.
04:39
Now let's stop the simulation.
04:42
And see how the range will work.
04:47
So for that I will comment this stuff.
04:51
Ohh let's remove it for now and I will put a for loop.
04:58
So for this loop we are going from zero.
05:02
So we were going from intensity 0 to.
05:06
255.
05:09
And we will increase the value by 10.
05:14
After each loop.
05:21
No, because it is an analog value, we do not have to turn it on and off. 
05:26
If we just need to turn it off, we can just pass the value 0 and it will be off. 
05:33
So we don't have to use multiple digital right or analogized statements. 
05:36
A single analog write statement will do perfectly in this situation.
05:44
Through Analog Writing ZA 02.
05:49
Have the value of I and then I want it to stay for 500 milliseconds. 
05:54
That's half a second, so we can actually see it changing. 
05:59
Now the only thing with Tinkercad is you cannot actually see the fading in or fading out or the gradual increase in brightness and gradual fall in.
06:11
Because that's how it's programmed to work. 
06:13
It only gives you total brightness and total darkness.
06:18
On an LED. 
06:19
So to make sure this works perfectly you will have to work on it on your actual Arduino and see how the brightness changes.
06:30
But in this case, what should happen on your real Arduino is that first the eye value will be 0, so it will be dark, then it goes to 10, so it will be slightly bright, and then it will go to 20, so a little more brighter. 
06:44
And by the time it reaches 255, or in this case 250 because we're increasing it by 10.
06:50
It should be as bright as it can go out on that value in that loop and then it should go back to zero. 
06:58
Why? 
06:58
Because once it reaches 25250, it will execute and it will go to 260.
07:04
But 260 does not satisfy the condition. 
07:07
So it should complete the void loop and then because it repeats, it should start from again and that means is reset to zero. 
07:16
OK, now let me show you now again you will not be able to see the gradual fade.
07:24
But this is how it works.
07:38
The reason you will not be able to see the fade in the values is because you're not programmed. 
07:43
This is not programmed to work like that.
08:11
So for the next.
08:14
To follow up on this video, I would like to try using while loop to do the same thing. 
08:20
Now while loop is another kind of loop that we use. 
08:23
It has just slightly since textual differences, but it should work the same way and when you use it on your actual Arduino you will be able to see how it changes and.
08:36
And.
08:38
For this one, we're increasing the value. 
08:40
Try doing the reverse. 
08:41
So try starting from the brightest and eventually go into the darker side and see how it turns out.
08:48
See you in the next video.
    
Welcome back guys. 
00:03
So this time we are working on server motor. 
00:07
Server motor is pretty simple, it's a motor with a movable arm on it and based on how many degrees of rotation you program it to, it will rotate that many degrees. 
00:18
The only problem with the servo motor.
00:21
It can only go up to 180 decrease, so you only have a fixed range of motion in it. 
00:27
But still it's very useful in some cases, like opening a box or making an automatic door. 
00:33
In that case the server motors are really helpful where you don't want something to spring completely open.
00:40
And you only want to have a limited range of motion in it. 
00:44
So let's get to programming it.
00:49
Server motor is pretty simple to wire again.
00:53
Usually a several motor comes with a.
00:57
Been set so it's 3 pins combined and based. 
01:00
Usually there will be wired in three colors so yellow or orange, red and brown, brown or black. 
01:05
So that is the one you connect to ground. 
01:08
The middle one which is usually red is the one you connect to power and the yellow or orange or green depending on the color.
01:17
You actually connected the.
01:23
Now like other.
01:26
Sensors that we have recently used, it also takes the library. 
01:30
It is a it is called servo dot edge. 
01:33
Once you include the library, which I'm confident you guys know how to do that, we create a server mode, a library variable. 
01:42
So servo motor is here is the variable for server motor.
01:46
For the service they provide.
01:49
So whenever we refer to the servo motor itself, we use this variable because it is linked to that library.
01:57
Now we have it at A1.
02:00
And here is the degree of rotation. 
02:03
As I told you, we only go from zero to 180. 
02:07
That's what we're doing. 
02:08
First thing we do is we attach the pin number to the servo motor. 
02:13
Here it is a special function that we don't normally use. 
02:18
It is servo motor dot attach.
02:20
And in brackets he put the pin number. 
02:24
This tells Arduino that if the servo motor specifically is connected to this pin.
02:32
And now in loop we actually not writing the code here we're calling 2 functions.
02:38
No functions. 
02:38
I thought that was an interesting concept to introduce here. 
02:42
So if you have a piece of code that you are repeating all the time in your code. 
02:47
So say there's like 3 lines that you're repeating every 2-3 sentences. 
02:51
So instead of copy pasting it again and again.
02:55
What do you do? 
02:56
You create a function so say, avoid repeating lines.
03:01
And in that function you write those 3 lines.
03:05
And instead of writing those 3 lines every other line, or every other section of your code you just write, you just call that function. 
03:14
So three random lines, 3 random lines, 3 random lines. 
03:18
In that way you shorten your code and you make it more easier to read and work with. 
03:24
So suppose.
03:25
If you decide to change one of those 3 lines, instead of changing it from 10 different places, you only change it at one in the function, and all the other tendencies are already changed because they're all picking up from the same location. 
03:39
That is kind of what we're doing here. 
03:42
So we have two functions. 
03:43
One is moving 90°, which will move your Arduino 90°.
03:49
And then bring it back 19° and the same thing that we're doing with 180.
03:55
Let's focus on 90° first.
03:59
So in the function for 90°.
04:03
We are using the for loop if you remember how to use a for loop.
04:08
Which is very simple. 
04:10
You're going from zero to 90 and every time you're increasing its value by one, because A+ plus means a equal to a + 1.
04:20
So here we are actually writing the degree to the servo motor.
04:27
So first we're telling server motor if you say right zero, then we're telling server motor go to position zero and then we give it one go to position one or go to 1°. 
04:40
Then we suppose down the line we give it servomotor dot right 45, it will go to 45°.
04:50
So we have enough time to see the rotation and after that we are slowly returning back from 90 to 0. 
04:57
So it's coming back to its original position. 
05:00
It's pretty straightforward. 
05:01
Let's see.
05:04
90°.
05:07
Now let's slow it down a little bit so we can.
05:11
See it happening?
05:18
It went 90°, then it came back 90°, went 90° and then it came back. 
05:23
Now let's do the same thing but.
05:27
180°.
05:31
Instead of having to comment these all lines, I only have to comment there's one line, so that makes it a lot easier because these functions are not executed unless they are called. 
05:41
So even if I have 20 functions.
05:44
And I only need to execute one of them. 
05:47
If I only call that single one, only that will be displayed executed. 
05:51
Having 20 functions doesn't mean all 20 will be executed even if they are not commented.
05:59
180°.
06:03
180° and it comes back.
06:07
So this is a server motor. 
06:09
Again, it is a very simple concept, but it is a very practically useful one.
06:15
Now again, just because we're working with something like Arduino, it doesn't mean everything has to be really complicated and everything has to be really.
06:27
Difficult to process or difficulty use.
06:31
Some things like there's beauty in simplicity, so if something is easy.
06:38
That does not mean it's bad, it means it is used in something in a different way.
06:44
And something that's easier for you may be difficult for other people. 
06:47
So just because something is very easy to work with, it doesn't mean it is not useful.
06:53
And which is one thing that people usually struggle with, if something is really easy, they don't realize that it is useful.
07:01
I know this is easy about something complicated, but.
07:05
To understand complicated stuff, you need to learn the basic ones. 
07:08
That's why I keep throwing some simpler stuff in the mix so it is easier for everyone and it sort of keeps changing the pace so it's.
07:17
Never boring. 
07:18
It's fresh, so if you're struggling with one thing, you get some time to catch up with the next one.
07:25
OK, so.
07:26
That's it for this one, but see you next time. 
    
Hello everyone welcome back. 
00:04
Now since we have completed serial display now we are moving on to LCD display. 
00:10
Now in LCD display we actually use a library.
00:14
And it is the first time we are using a library here. 
00:18
But don't worry, it's pretty simple and pretty straightforward an LCD display like you know it's.
00:23
Display screen, which you can actually plug into your Arduino using jumper cables or a breadboard and.
00:32
Display messages on it instead of using a serial monitor, because in serial monitor you're essentially bound to a monitor or a computer where you have to connect it physically.
00:44
And it is not very convenient most of the time. 
00:47
So if you want to leave your Arduino in a place where you don't have room or it is not just not practical enough to carry your laptop or your computers, there they are doing a project. 
00:58
You can use an LCD display for displaying messages.
01:02
Now how do we work with this? 
01:04
Again, it is pretty simple.
01:07
Connection for this it It does have a lot of wires so don't be worried about it. 
01:12
It does take a few minutes or a few times to get used to it.
01:17
So if you see from this end, the outer wire is connected to negative terminal and the inner one is to positive terminal. 
01:25
This happens on the both the edges. 
01:27
So outer ones are negative and inner ones are positive. 
01:31
So that's the.
01:34
2 pins on either of the edges.
01:37
No the side that says DB 7 so it goes from DB0 to DB7 so you start pinning it from DB7 through B4. 
01:46
So you have these 4 pins that you actually connect to your Arduino.
01:53
Now for this we generally use the dish soap pins and then you skip DB3 to DB0. 
01:59
So you skip these four and you see the East.
02:05
Again it goes toward. 
02:06
We know the RW goes to the negative terminal and then we get the Rs. 
02:12
This goes to the Arduino again.
02:16
After Mrs. 
02:16
Nelson's, we have already covered the last two on the edges. 
02:20
We only have the one in the middle. 
02:22
That's the V-0 which is left to connect. 
02:25
Now V-0 we actually connect to the middle pin.
02:29
Of a potential meter.
02:33
Now, what is the potential meter and what does it do? 
02:35
We'll get to that.
02:38
The outer 2 pins of the potential meter are one is connected to, +1 is connected to negative. 
02:44
It doesn't matter which one you do, just one is negative and one is positive and the middle one is connected to LCD display.
02:53
Now Violet talked to you about.
02:56
The work of potential meter in this case.
03:00
I will leave this up so you guys can note down or pin your adrenal. 
03:06
Do you also do display?
03:09
Potential meter is kind of like a dialogue.
03:12
You can rotate it and adjust its value so.
03:17
In this case, this value determines the contrast of the alphabets displayed on your Arduino screen.
03:25
Or on your LCD screen. 
03:26
So if you feel like it's not contrasting enough and it's not really readable, you can twist it enough and increase the contrast, or decrease the contrast to make it more visible and more readable.
03:39
Now I hope you guys have connected it, so let's move on to the coding section.
03:47
No, as I said, we use a liquid Crystal library which is capital L and capital C.
03:53
We connected using a hashtag include.
03:58
Now this is a keyword which helps you to install or include libraries into your code.
04:05
And the second step is to create.
04:09
A liquid crystal variable which we will use to identify or else we display.
04:15
Now in this case I have called this variable LCD, but you can call your variable anything that you like.
04:22
So we do liquid crystal space the variable name and in bracket.
04:28
We have 8 numbers, sorry, we have 6 numbers and those numbers move from Rs to DB7. 
04:34
But we don't point at all of them. 
04:37
We only note down the ones that we have actually used to connect. 
04:42
So first one is Rs. 
04:43
Rs is connected to pin number 8, so we write 8.
04:51
So 8, 9 and then you go from Ed's four to DB7 which is 10/11/12 and 13. 
04:58
So our total becomes 8910111213 and that is what we write inside the brackets for or inside the parentheses for the LCD.
05:09
Variable.
05:12
No, just the way we did it for the.
05:16
Serial monitor we are going to do an LCD don't begin like in serial monitor. 
05:22
We did 9600 to identify in a serial monitor. 
05:26
Here we use 16, 2.
05:30
Now it can be something other than 16, 2, but we are using 16, 2 because we are using a 16 by 2 LCD display. 
05:40
What that means is we have this display has two rows of 16 digit 16 character spaces each.
05:48
So at the time you can display 16 columns, 16 characters in a line and we only have two lines.
06:00
Now let's go to the displaying part.
06:05
So first let me comment this thing out.
06:13
And let's just go with something simple. 
06:15
Simple. 
06:15
Now, as I said, we have two rows, so we have to determine where we want characters to be displayed.
06:22
So we need to use LCD set cursor. 
06:26
Now remember this LCD's not a keyword, it's just a variable name. 
06:31
So whatever your name thinks in this line.
06:35
Is what you will use. 
06:37
If you call it display it will be display dot begin display dot set cursor, display dot print, display dot clear.
06:45
Now for LCD set cursor means we choose a starting point. 
06:50
Now 00 will be first line, first character.
06:55
And from there we start printing. 
06:57
So the first alphabet W will be printed at the first line first character space.
07:03
So it says welcome to Arduino.
07:08
And I'm not clearing it, so let's see what this says.
07:14
Now, because this is not an ideal setup for Arduino, you can obviously see the warning because the current is high.
07:24
Normally it won't happen when you're using a real 1, so don't worry about it.
07:28
So it says welcome to Audrey. 
07:31
Now NO is cut off.
07:33
And the reason behind that is because.
07:37
This statement in total is 18 characters, so only 16 can be displayed because remember it's only 16 characters faces.
07:45
So the last two are omitted.
07:48
And to make sure they are displayed, we need to do something.
07:59
And that is?
08:02
Displayed in pieces.
08:05
So here it says we only display welcome to in our first line. 
08:10
Let's see.
08:13
Welcome to this displayed.
08:18
Now I'm going to add the word Arduino to the second line. 
08:22
I receive 1 and 2. 
08:24
That means second line, third character.
08:31
It says welcome to an Arduino comes in the second line.
08:37
No.
08:39
It's pretty simple, you have to actually move your cursor before you start printing it that location, because our display in itself doesn't know, like it doesn't recognize that.
08:51
It's going beyond the limits. 
08:52
We need to move to the next line. 
08:54
It does not recognize them, so we have to manually do that.
08:59
No, not something very complicated, but something you sure need to plan out. 
09:03
So make sure everything is 16 characters or less, or use abbreviations if you have a longer message.
09:09
Now what does LCD dot clear mean?
09:13
Now sometimes in between displays you have multiple things displaying one after the other.
09:22
But.
09:24
Sometimes we don't really notice that they are not in the same line.
09:30
So what I'm going to do I'm putting a delay function.
09:34
So you can actually see it changing.
09:37
So I want so the welcome too. 
09:39
And the Arduino will now be in the same line, same position.
09:44
I'm putting a delay so you can see it transitioned from Welcome to.
09:50
So it says welcome to.
09:53
And after a second it should go to.
09:57
Yeah, it did display Arduino for a second. 
09:59
Let me do this.
10:03
So you can see.
10:05
Change this to 500.
10:09
800 so delay 500 is just like a waiting period. 
10:12
So sometimes if you need something to wait after every step you can do it. 
10:16
Now if you see welcome to and it says Arduino 2 welcome to Arduino 2. 
10:21
Why is that?
10:23
Because.
10:25
LCD does not clear stuff on its own, so you have to manually tell it to clear the lines.
10:32
Otherwise it will just overlap and everything, thus remaining. 
10:35
It will override individual characters that are needed, but others will remain the same. 
10:39
So it will not clear the whole line, it will just clear the characters that need to.
10:46
So I'm just going to do an LCD clear.
10:50
And then it should clear from one step to another. 
10:54
So welcome to now the 2 is not displaying because welcome 2 is cleared and then Arduino is displayed on top.
11:02
And I have not done a clear after the Arduino because Arduino is less characters than welcome to, so it will override the whole thing. 
11:09
So we don't really necessarily do that.
11:15
Now that is it for today.    
Hey, guys, welcome back. 
00:04
So I feel like we haven't really went that deep into the LCD display, so I wanted to just touch base with it a little bit more.
00:16
Ohh here I have added a button.
00:20
And I will. 
00:21
I believe I've already showed you how to connect a button, but.
00:25
For a button, you connect to one side with a positive terminal and you connect a resistor.
00:33
To the negative terminal and.
00:36
On the side that you connect to the resistor, you connect it to what we know.
00:41
So here right now I have commented out all the LCD code.
00:47
So right now it's just the button and the way it's working is if the button is pressed, which means the pin number is high, it will print high to it. 
00:57
So let's see how it's working right now. 
01:00
So I press the button and it prints high.
01:05
Pretty simple.
01:07
Now let's stop this simulation. 
01:08
And what I want to do is every time I press the button, it should say the button is pressed.
01:24
But I wanted to say on.
01:27
The LCD.
01:45
Not because we know we have limited space. 
01:47
I'm not putting the whole sentence, I'm just putting a button. 
01:50
This button pressed.
01:52
And let's test this one out.
01:57
It's clear to see what I would monitor and.
02:01
I pressed the button and the side button pressed, but as you know it's keep on displaying it. 
02:06
It's not going back. 
02:08
So what I will do, I'll put an LCD dot clear. 
02:11
I'll just uncomment this one.
02:14
But I want this line after a certain delay.
02:20
I don't want this right away.
02:23
So let's start.
02:26
And press it.
02:28
Life. 
02:28
You see once I stop pressing it goes back button pressed.
02:35
Now.
02:39
Stop this simulation.
02:43
If the button is not pressed, what I want it to do?
02:49
Very simple. 
02:50
I want to display something else.
03:01
I'll just say nothing too.
03:05
Display.
03:07
Or.
03:09
I'll just say nothing.
03:12
Now if you notice I already have an LCD clear which will clear after every.
03:18
Loop so I don't have to put an LCD dot clear after every single line.
03:24
Which is why I'm not putting an LCD clear here.
03:30
Let's add another line to it.
03:51
It's constantly saying nothing to display.
03:54
No one.
03:56
That is because I don't have anything displaying or I don't have press the button yet. 
04:02
But as soon as I press the button I want to see what's happening.
04:08
No. 
04:08
Typically it should only be happening once and then it should clear it and display. 
04:13
But because I'm constantly holding on to the button, it's.
04:17
Constantly displaying it, but do you see that it's flickering every now and then? 
04:22
Now that flickering is because it's doing LCD clear and then it's going and reading again. 
04:28
But that's happening so fast that the LCD doesn't really have a time to fully clear sometimes. 
04:34
Sometimes it does, but mostly it doesn't.
04:39
Now if I reduce the time between the clears even more, it will get a lot smoother.
04:54
And it's flickering, but it's flickering faster because it's still clearing.
04:59
Now what will happen if I don't display or if I don't clear?
05:05
As I told you it only clears the cells that it needs to. 
05:09
It doesn't clear all the cells. 
05:11
So in this way it says nothing to display. 
05:15
But when I press it, it says button pressed to display. 
05:19
Now our message does not have to display in it for pressing the button.
05:24
It's displayed because when the button pressed, override overrode the nothing to display. 
05:29
It only covered nothing. 
05:31
It did not go to the display setting.
05:35
Which is why it is important to ensure that you know how your spacing is working and you know.
05:42
Ohh, you're clearing it so if you have something to display if I say nothing to display and button to display if I have two messages.
05:51
And the two displays always in second line. 
05:54
I don't necessarily have to erase it every single time, right? 
05:58
I just need to make it look good. 
06:00
So to save the LCD some extra computing time I can just leave it there and don't use LCD dot clear. 
06:08
But.
06:09
If we have multiple messages, there's a possibility that it gets overlapped, so it's always important to do LCD dot clear.
06:19
Anyways, that's it for this one. 
06:21
See you next time.
    
00:03
Hey, welcome back everyone. 
00:04
So this time we're actually working with a very simple rhythm sensor, which is called a photoresistor. 
00:10
Now photo resistor is typically an analog sensor, but here I've connected it to this to open. 
00:17
As I've told you earlier, we can also use the digital pin.
00:23
The only difference is instead of digital write or digital read, we use an analog read and that is what we have done here.
00:31
Here I have all four photo resistor. 
00:33
How you connect it is.
00:37
You take a 10K ohm resistor which you connect to its negative side.
00:47
Leaders.
00:50
And you also connect that same side to Arduino and you connect the other side to the positive terminal.
01:00
I've also added two LED lights, 1 red and 1 blue. 
01:03
I want the red one to be turned on if the light is above 500, and if the light is below 500 the blue one should turn on.
01:13
No one is above or below 500. 
01:16
That means the value or the range that photo resistor will give us. 
01:20
Because photo resistor being an analog device, gives values in a range from zero to 500 or 500 to 1000. 
01:28
So it's total range is zero to 1000.
01:32
So I have split down the middle and I'm using 500 as my benchmark.
01:38
So let's see the code.
01:41
Here again I have.
01:44
Displayed the pin modes.
01:50
So 13 and 12 are are LED lights.
02:01
And a servant is a photosystem, so I've defined it as input.
02:07
No, because I said it is an analog sensor so it has a range of values. 
02:11
I'm just doing an analog read of it. 
02:13
So if it's analog read, it's greater than 500. 
02:16
The red one is turning on and the blue one is turning off.
02:20
Now you should be able to see the values on serial monitor.
02:25
So in order to do that.
02:28
Just going to do.
02:32
Going to take this.
02:51
I'm going to display the value of well.
03:04
Let's start.
03:10
Now if you see very carefully, the both lights are flickering, so one is turning off, another is going on without any real sense.
03:19
Now that is because.
03:21
This is a simulation, so this is not really the real life, but if you do the same thing in real life, you will get much clearer results. 
03:31
The reason you're not getting proper results here is because.
03:36
It's think or get and it does not have all the real time values all the time, so some of the values can be flawed.
03:45
Which is the reason the values from this particular emulator is not exactly reliable in this matter.
03:53
But still you're able to figure out that it's all working properly and you are able to see how this is flickering among each other. 
04:00
So if the value is ever above 500, the red ones turning on, and if it's below 500 the blue ones turning on, even though the values are completely random.
04:16
That's why I suggest like whenever you guys try doing it, I suggest that you do it without Tinkercad. 
04:23
I would like you to use Tinkercad solely as a planning of the circuit instead of directly creating a circuit because this is not 100% reliable but creating a circuit on Tinkercad.
04:36
It gives you an idea of how everything is connected and that.
04:42
Minimizes the risk the risk of short circuiting or mismatching the wires or wrong connections, which can eventually just damage your equipment that you're using.
04:54
But anyways, this was a really short introduction to photo resistors. 
04:58
I thought it would be fun for you guys to have a look at it. 
05:02
And that's it for today. 
05:03
See you tomorrow.
   
Hey guys, now we're working on another sensor and that's temperature and humidity sensor.
00:09
Now for this sensor we use DHT library pretty similar to how we used Liquid Crystal library for.
00:19
LCD display the same way we used HD library for temperature and humidity sensor.
00:26
Now, one important thing to know about these sensors is there are two different kinds of sensors. 
00:31
There's one DHT 11 and there's a different kind which is DHD 12 or 22. 
00:36
I'm not entirely sure on that. 
00:38
But in this case, we are using the DHT 11.
00:43
Now as the name suggests, it tells you the temperature and humidity of the environment and it's pretty simple, simple to use. 
00:50
Now there's some complicated versions of using this that I've seen online, but this is the easiest version that I've found and I think you guys will be.
00:59
Able to learn this pretty easily.
01:02
Now the first thing I want to tell you about Tinkercad is it does not have the ideal version of DHT 11 that I would like to show you guys. 
01:13
So for this one.
01:15
If you go to Google images and this is actually the kind of sensor like DHT 11, this is the sensor that I will be explaining you for because the one in Tinkercad is not exactly programmable as DHT 11.
01:32
Now you notice this has four pins, but we only use three of them, so the first one will be the positive terminal.
01:41
The second one is the one that you will connect.
01:45
Do your sensors.
01:48
Arduino pin.
01:50
Or in this case it will be an analog pin and you skip the third one and the last one will be the one you connect to the ground pin.
01:59
And it's pretty straightforward. 
02:00
You also need to use a 330.
02:05
Resistor with the data pin.
02:09
So you connect the data up into the resistor and that is how you program it and in order to not to burn it which.
02:17
Is very easy to do, I have done that. 
02:21
So even if that happens it's alright. 
02:23
So just need to make sure that you cross check your wiring everywhere before you actually wire it and run it because it is very likely that you end up burning it, which is totally normal.
02:39
Now, since you know how to pin it, it's again pretty simple, just three pins, don't use the third one.
02:46
And that's pretty much it. 
02:47
And also you can find these images on Google, you just need to search DHT 11 sensor.
02:54
And you will be able to find it now in order to code it. 
02:57
I can show you the code here.
03:01
Now pretty much the way we did with Liquid Crystal, we include the HD library again, DHTML capital and then we actually creating a DHT sensor.
03:14
Now this is a variable, the sensor is a variable, and DHD is a class. 
03:20
So you're creating a variable of the Sensor class.
03:24
And in our case that is an 8.
03:33
Now, how do you know that you're displaying a sensor?
03:38
How do you know what kind? 
03:40
Because again I said there's two different kinds for that. 
03:43
He used the Read 11. 
03:45
Read 11 tells the art. 
03:46
We know that it is a DHD 11 kind of sensor and it functions accordingly.
03:52
So we do sensor which is again ADHD variable.
03:57
Dot read 11 and then we put in the pin number. 
04:01
The pin number is temperature, humidity sensor A8.
04:06
Now getting the value for temperature and humidity is very simple. 
04:10
You just do DHT or in this case it is sensor.
04:20
So you simply do sensor temperature and sensor humidity and it will return you float values of those. 
04:27
Remember they are always float.
04:31
And to print them, you just simply print them. 
04:33
The temperature will come in Celsius, so if you want to display it in Fahrenheit you will have to convert it to Fahrenheit or Kelvin based on what you want. 
04:42
And the humidity is always in percentage.
04:45
Now, because we don't have anything connected, I cannot really show you how this works because we don't have this version on Tinkercad. 
04:54
But again, this is very simple code and the wiring is also pretty simple as well. 
05:00
It's just three pins out of four and just make sure you.
05:05
Make it correctly on, especially on Arduino CC which is a really good website for you to use in order to find it and see how it is programmed and how it is connected. 
05:16
Now there are different versions of using DHT library.
05:19
And there are different versions of DHD library. 
05:22
So this is the one that I use. 
05:24
It is capital DH&T.
05:26
And I find it very easy because all you need to do to get the values is these three lines.
05:34
And it's very simple to use as well because you just use sensor temperature and you have the temperature, you just use sensor humidity and you have the humidity.
05:45
And also, this is a really good sensor, like I told you earlier for your project. 
05:51
So if you want to add this, what I prefer doing with projects is I like working on individual sensors or individual components separately. 
05:59
So I have different codes for all of them. 
06:02
I work with them individually, make sure they're all working.
06:05
Separately.

Welcome to the video tutorials of Mechanisms by me, Conn's Mueller.
00:13
In this video, I will try to explain the working principles of a rocket and rocket engine.
00:20
A rocket has four main parts. 
00:23
The first part is the payload. 
00:25
The payload can be anything from a satellite, a warhead and human beings for the space exploration. 
00:32
The second part is the fuel tank, which is a huge tank filled with liquid hydrogen or any other type of.
00:40
Fuel.
00:42
The third part is a huge oxygen tank which allows the rocket engine to operate in an airless environment such as space.
00:49
The 4th and most complex part of the rocket is the rocket engine. 
00:54
The main parts of the rocket engine are start tank.
01:00
Mixing tank.
01:04
Turbine for generating power for the pumps.
01:09
Fuel boost pump.
01:13
Oxygen boost pump.
01:17
Combustion chamber.
01:21
Throat.
01:24
Nozzle.
01:28
Let's describe the working details of the rocket engine. 
01:32
During the ignition process, the material inside the start tank creates enough pressurized gas to operate the turbine. 
01:39
The turbine is coupled to the fuel and oxygen pumps.
01:44
Therefore, the operation of the turbine forces the fuel and oxygen to the combustion chamber by using pumps.
01:52
Once the fuel and oxygen are mixed in the combustion chamber, it is ignited and the operation of the engine starts.
02:00
At the same time, a small portion of the fuel and oxygen are diverted to the mixing chamber.
02:06
Fuel and oxygen mixture is ignited inside the mixing tank to create pressurized gas to power the turbine. 
02:13
The outlet of the turbine is connected to the exhaust pipe to discharge the expanded gases to the environment.
02:21
This process continues as long as their fuel or oxygen is in the tanks.
02:26
As many of you may know, rockets work with the same principle as a fire hose.
02:32
When you hold a fire hose, you will experience thrust on your body in the opposite direction of the water flow. 
02:39
This thrust is proportional to the speed and amount of water being discharged from the hose.
02:45
The bigger the flow rate or faster the flow speed, the more you will experience thrust on your body. 
02:52
For a rocket, the higher the amount of fuel and oxygen disposed from the nozzle, the more thrust will be generated for the same exit velocity of gases.
03:02
Thrust generated by exit gases is also proportional to the speed of the exit gases. 
03:07
The faster the gas flow from the nozzle, the more thrust will be generated.
03:15
Now there is one problem here. 
03:17
We know that to make water flow faster, we have to make the exit hole as small as possible. 
03:23
However, with the rocket engine, the nozzle expands and the exit area actually gets larger. 
03:29
You may think that is would reduce the speed of the exit gases, but On the contrary.
03:35
Compressible gases do not behave like water.
03:39
Instead, when the flow area of pressurized gas decreases, its velocity will increase. 
03:44
This process continues until the speed of the gas reaches the speed of sound.
03:50
At which point reducing the area causes shock waves to be generated inside the nozzle. 
03:55
To prevent shock waves from generating and to increase the gas velocity, the area of the nozzle must be gradually increased.
04:04
We call the area where flow speed is going from subsonic to supersonic the throat of the nozzle. 
04:11
This phenomenon is very strange, but it's true. 
04:14
Not shown in this video are the cooling pipes from the fuel pipe circling around the nozzle. 
04:20
These pipes Preheat the fuel while it's cooling the nozzle.
04:26

The hybrid rocket engine is a combination of solids and liquid propellant engines.
00:06
The hybrid rocket engine is first used in space on the spaceship too.
00:12
And another example on land used a hybrid rocket engine is in Bloodhound supersonic car.
00:24
In this video we go to look at what inside a hybrid rocket engine and how does it works.
00:33
Let's see the technical details of the hybrid engine.
00:39
This is the oxidizer tank. 
00:41
The oxidizer is stored in the form of liquid. 
00:45
What is an oxidizer? 
00:46
An oxidizer is a type of chemical which a fuel requires to burn. 
00:51
Common oxidizers include liquid oxygen, nitrous oxide, and hydrogen peroxide.
00:58
This is the turbo pump for pumping liquid oxidizer into the combustion chamber.
01:07
This is the flow control valve. 
01:09
It is used to control the flow of the oxidizer. 
01:13
The valve controls how fast the oxidizer is allowed to interact with fuel, meaning that it can control the trust.
01:22
The solid fuel is stored inside the combustion chamber. 
01:25
The common solid fuel are included polymers, cross-linked rubber or liquefying fuels.
01:35
This is the fuel injector. 
01:38
It converts liquid oxidizer into small droplets, then spray inside the combustion chamber.
01:47
Nozzle convergent Divergent nozzle. 
01:48
It expands and accelerates the combustion gas. 
01:51
Let's explore the working principle of the engine. 
01:55
With the help of turbo pump, the liquid oxidizer is pumped into the combustion chamber.
02:03
Then the fuel injector converts the liquid oxidizer into small droplets.
02:09
With the help of an electrical signal, the igniter generates spark.
02:15
Due to the ignition, the combustion takes place. 
02:18
The highly heated product of combustion gases is then allowed to expand in the nozzle section. 
02:23
These gases are coming out with very high velocity. 
02:27
A force or thrust will be produced in the opposite direction. 
02:31
This trust propels the vehicle.
02:34
The hybrid rocket motor provides several distinct advantages such as simplicity, safety, low cost and thrust throttling over both solid propellant and liquid propellant motors, which make it suitable for a broad range of applications including sounding rocket, tactical missile, launch, vehicle propulsion and space.


All other Newton, you're good at one minute. 
00:03
In this video we will explore rocket stability. 
00:05
The stability of an object is its tendency to restore itself to its original condition when disturbed. 
00:10
Inherent stability of rocket depends on the centre of mass and centre of pressure. 
00:13
The centre of mass is the point where all the mass of the rocket can be considered to act as an object in free flight.
00:20
Can only rotate about its center of mass. 
00:23
And now for center of pressure. 
00:25
If we imagine pressure to be created by particles of our impacting rocket, as shown here with rocket at an exaggerated angle, the stream of particles impacting this point will exert deforest, denoted by the blue arrow. 
00:37
This force cannot be decomposed into the component of 90° or normal.
00:41
Rocket in red and the force along actually to the rocket in pink. 
00:45
The actual pink component of the forest is what we call the aerodynamic drag, and while this is important for rocket performance, it is not at all important to determine rockets under pressure and resulting stability. 
00:56
We can thus discard the drag force. 
00:58
We can repeat this exercise for every point along the rocket.
01:01
To obtain a normal force distribution along this distribution, there's a point there as much normal force acts ahead of it as behind it. 
01:08
This is much like the gravitational force ahead and behind of the balance point. 
01:12
This point is called the centre of pressure and all of the forces along the rocket can be summed up to single force. 
01:19
Said duct. 
01:19
Only at the centre of pressure, this force.
01:22
Acting at the center of pressure will produce a moment about the center of mass rotating the rocket. 
01:27
Knowing this, we can work out how the relationship between the locations of central pressure and central mass determine the stability of a rocket. 
01:34
If the center of pressure is ahead of the central mass, any small disturbance will result in a normal force and movement in the direction of the serpents.
01:42
And the Rockets spinning out of control. 
01:44
If the center of pressure is behind the central mouse, on the other hand, any disturbance will result in a moment created restoring the rocket to its original orientation. 
01:53
The rocket is thus stable. 
01:54
We can see that the greater the distances between the centre of pressure and the centre of mass, the longer lever arm, the normal force house and the Rockets tendency to rotate.
02:03
Will also be greater. 
02:05
To be able to apply this to an actual rocket launch, we need to elaborate on a few things. 
02:10
Mainly that in practice the central pressure for rocket is not a fixed point, but shifts as the pressure distribution changes. 
02:16
For example, if the rocket is at a great angle to the airflow, the centre of pressure generally moves forward. 
02:21
Centre of pressure also shifts dramatically when breaking the sound barrier.
02:25
And then usually gradually moves forward with increasing Mach number. 
02:27
So now onto the fun part of going back to the footage shown at the beginning and applying what we have learned from this graph. 
02:34
We can see the location of the center of mass and center of pressure during the initial stage of Saturn 5 launch. 
02:39
As you can see, the central mass steadily moves forward as the fuel in the first stage is being consumed, while the centre of pressure suddenly jumps at about 60 seconds.
02:47
To fight the jumping center of pressure interestingly happens at the same time the Saturn 5 broke the sound barrier. 
02:54
From this craft we can see that the only time within the 1st 2 minutes the Saturn 5 was aerodynamically stable was when it broke the sound barrier and experienced the resulting shockwave. 
03:04
When experiencing the shockwave was presumably when the rocket was in the greatest need of stability.
03:09
This in turn indicates that a physicists and engineers involved in constructing these rockets have a deep understanding of these concepts and their ability to apply them.

Do you remember the Newton's first law of motion?
00:09
It says that an object will continue to do what it's doing unless acted upon by an unbalanced force or some net force. 
00:16
Now the important question is what happens when there is net force acting on an object?
00:23
That's precisely what the second law of motion will discuss. 
00:26
Do you remember understanding the first law of motion with a simple diagram? 
00:31
If the forces are balanced, the acceleration will be 0. 
00:34
In the first case, the object will continue to remain at rest, and in the second, the object will continue to stay in motion.
00:43
At the same velocity and in the same direction.
00:46
Don't forget, these two cases will remain true only if the forces are balanced, only if the net force is 0. 
00:55
Now let's try to create a similar diagram for the second case. 
00:59
If the forces are unbalanced, then there will be acceleration. 
01:03
We saw that in the previous video.
01:06
And now we come to the interesting part. 
01:09
Let me ask you a question, and I'm sure you can answer it. 
01:13
On which two factors do you think the acceleration will depend on? 
01:17
I want you to tax your brain a bit. 
01:20
Let me repeat my question. 
01:22
On which two factors do you think will the acceleration depend on?
01:29
OK, let's say there's an object on a table, you alley a net force of 10 units on it, and then you alley a net force of 20 units on it. 
01:38
In which case do you think the acceleration will be more? 
01:41
Of course, the one in which the force was more. 
01:44
So we can say that one of the things the acceleration.
01:48
Depends on its net force. 
01:50
If it's small, then more will be the acceleration. 
01:53
If it's less, then lesser will be the acceleration. 
01:57
Acceleration depends directly on the net force. 
01:59
Come on now, I want you to think about the second quantity the acceleration will depend on.
02:08
Let's say there are two objects on the table. 
02:11
One has a mass of 3 kilograms and the other has a mass of 5 kilograms. 
02:16
Now if you apply net force of 10 units to each of them, which one do you think will accelerate more? 
02:23
Surely it's the three KG one because it has lesser mass. 
02:27
Lesser the mass?
02:28
More the acceleration and more the mass, less of the acceleration.
02:34
Hence, we can say that acceleration depends inversely on the object's mass.
02:40
If you've understand this concept well, then understanding the second law of motion will be very easy. 
02:47
Mathematically, it can be written like this. 
02:49
In simple terms, the acceleration is directly proportional to the net force applied and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. 
02:58
That's the second law.
03:00
Whereas more people understand it like this. 
03:03
The net force is the product of mass and acceleration. 
03:07
With this, can you tell me the units of force that should be easy. 
03:13
The standard unit of mass is kilograms and that of acceleration is meters per second squared.
03:20
So the unit of forces kilograms times meters per second squared and this is what we call as Newton 1. 
03:28
Newton is 1 kilogram times meters per second squared. 
03:31
So if the mass of the object is 10 kilograms and the acceleration is 10 meters per second squared, then the force will equal.
03:40
100 Newtons. 
03:41
We can say that one Newton is defined as the amount of force required to give a 1 kilogram mass and acceleration of 1m per second squared.

The only question you need to ask yourself while studying the third law is what happens when 2 objects interact with each other? 
00:12
What happens when you place an object on the table, the object exerts a force on the table and the subject exerts?
00:20
An upward force on the object. 
00:22
There are two forces that result from this interaction, a force on the table and a force on the object. 
00:29
The magnitudes of the two forces are the same, but the directions are opposite. 
00:35
These forces are called as action and reaction forces. 
00:38
The force exerted by the object.
00:40
In the table was an action force, and the force exerted by the table on the object is the reaction force. 
00:48
What we saw here is nothing but a display of the Newton's third law of motion. 
00:54
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 
00:57
That's how simple the third law is every action.
01:01
Has an equal and opposite reaction. 
01:03
It means that when 2 objects interact, there is a force on each object. 
01:08
The magnitude of force on the first object equals the magnitude of force on the second one. 
01:14
And what about the direction? 
01:16
The direction of force on the first object is opposite to the direction of.
01:21
On the second one, let's talk about more examples. 
01:25
While a frog is swimming, it pushes the water back, and the water pushes its body forward.
01:32
Now let me ask you a question. 
01:35
Say a bird is flying upwards. 
01:37
Will the Newton's third law apply here?
01:43
Sometimes the third law is not so obvious. 
01:46
You'd probably say that the bird is the only object here and there's no second object, but that's not correct. 
01:53
The wings of the bird pushed the air downwards, and the air pushes the bird upwards. 
01:59
Action and reaction forces make it possible for birds to fly.
02:04
We take one last example to understand something very interesting about the third law. 
02:09
What happens when a gun is fired? 
02:12
You're right, it exerts a forward force on the bullet, and the bullet exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the gun. 
02:21
And this exists in recoil of the gun. 
02:24
A perfect example.
02:25
Of Newton's third law.
02:28
But hold on, if the force exerted by the gun on the bullet is the same as the force exerted by the bullet on the gun, then why doesn't the gun recoil with the same acceleration as the bullet?
02:41
The gun recalls, yes, but it doesn't recoil at the same acceleration as the bullet, right? 
02:47
Same magnitude of forces, but different accelerations. 
02:50
Why do you think this happens?
02:57
OK, so if your concept of the second law of motion was clear, you wouldn't really be surprised with this. 
03:04
The second law of motion says that the force is the product of the object's mass and acceleration, or the acceleration of the object is equal to the force over its mass. 
03:15
What does this tell us?
03:17
Yes, if the mass is more, then the acceleration will be less. 
03:21
In this example, the mass of the gun is much more than that of the bullet. 
03:26
Hence the acceleration of the rifle is lesser than that of the bullet.
03:32
If you're in a boat and step out of it onto the land, there are two forces involved, you pushing the boat behind and the boat pushing you forward, and that's why you see the boat go behind when you go forward.
03:46
Now let's say a sailor jumps off a huge ship. 
03:50
The sailor does alley a force on the ship, and the ship also applies a force on the sailor. 
03:56
But do you think the ship will accelerate as much as the sailor? 
04:00
Not really, and I think you know why.

A solid propellant rocket. 
00:06
These are the earliest rockets were solid fuel rockets powered by gunpowders. 
00:11
They were used in warfare by the Chinese, Indians, ******* and Persians as early as the 13th century, as today the solid propellant rockets are still used in military armaments.
00:24
These are the solid propellant rocket. 
00:26
This rocket have bit of difference comparing with other. 
00:30
What is it?
00:32
It is the propellant. 
00:33
The propellant are in the form of solid materials. 
00:36
The propellant is a mixture of two components, 1 is oxidizer and another one is fuel.
00:43
Let's see the constructional details of the rocket.
00:47
Let me introduce each part of the rocket 1 by 1.
00:53
This is the casing, the outermost layer of the rocket. 
00:57
These layer is used to protect the rocket engine.
01:06
Insulation layer The second layer of the rocket, the insulation layer it do not conduct heat from the combustion chamber.
01:32
Nozzle converging.
01:34
Diverging nozzle. 
01:35
It is used for expand and accelerate the combustion gas from the propellant.
01:48
Propellant. 
01:49
The propellant are the mixture of fuel and oxidizer. 
01:52
Both of them are in solid material, so this is called solid propellant rocket.
02:32
Igniter with the help of electric signal to generate spark and burn the propellant.
02:43
Let us see the making procedure of the propellant.
02:49
The propellant are made by two chemical solid components. 
02:53
1 is oxidizer and another one is fuel. 
02:56
Commonly used oxidizer are nitrates, perchlorates, liquid oxygen, etcetera and fuel. 
03:01
They are in the form of plastic or resin material combining these two components.
03:08
And mix with above 58°C of heat then it become in the form of paste like this.
03:16
Then these two components mixture are fill into the cavity inside of rocket. 
03:21
Then the propellant is covered with an insulation layer. 
03:24
The blue color molecules are oxidizers, the red color are the fuel. 
03:28
So finally this propellant are ready to explosion.
03:36
Let us see the working principle of the solid propellant, the rocket engine.
03:42
With the help of electrical signal, the igniter will generate spark.
03:49
Due to the ignition, the combustion takes place.
03:55
When combustion takes place in combustion chamber, very high pressure and high temperature gas are produced. 
04:00
The highly heated products of combustion gases are then allowed to expand in the nozzle section. 
04:05
Then the nozzle pressure energy of gas is converted into kinetic energy. 
04:09
So these gases are coming out with very high velocity due to the gases coming out with.
04:15
Very high velocity from the nozzle. 
04:17
A force or thrust will produce an opposite direction.
04:22
This thrust propels the rocket, or the rocket will move forward.
04:33
Let's see what are the advantages of the solid propellant rocket.
04:39
They are simple in design and construction.
04:43
They do not need any feed system, less vibrations due to absence of moving parts like we see the disadvantages of solid propellant rocket.
04:55
In the case of emergency, the difficult to stop the engine in the midway.
05:02
Decrease the speed of the rocket is not possible.
05:06
It cannot able to stop the engine after once ignited.
05:13
Let's check the applications where it is used.
05:18
In military it is used to a launch missiles, it is used as a ***** ** boosters to increase the payload capacity and it is used in light launch vehicles.


So now we'll be learning about how to add filters with the adjustment filter option.
00:09
So you also have the option that says auto.
00:12
That ought to fix the image, and it'll add a little bit of vibrance, brightness in many other things. 
00:19
You can also cancel if you don't want that to happen, and you can also go ahead for black and white. 
00:27
That turns the image black and white, and that would basically mean that the saturation is -1.
00:34
Then we have pop that increases the vibrant saturation brightness to make the image look popped up.
00:44
But if you don't want that, we can also do it on our own.
00:49
So I'm going to increase the vibrance a little bit of the image to make it look good. 
00:56
Then we'll increase the saturation, decrease the temperature a little bit.
01:01
We're going to leave tent and huge just as it is because I'll add a little bit greenish colour and this side is going to add orangish colour for hue. 
01:12
That's going to basically keep on changing the color just like disco lights.
01:20
Then we have light, so brightness will increase the brightness of the image and taking it towards minus will decrease it. 
01:30
So let's have the vibrance a little bit increased, then exposure will give it a whitened effect and decreasing.
01:39
Will decrease the exposure contrast, will give it a blackish effect if you increase the contrast, and decreasing will give it a whitish contrast. 
01:49
So let's increase it a little bit.
01:53
Increasing the black will add black effect black colour to the image black toning.
02:01
Adding white will add white toning.
02:05
Highlights will basically help to highlight the main portions, the main attractions of the image and shadows will help to lighten the places which are having a shadowy effect.
02:20
Then we have details. 
02:21
Sharpening the image will make it really sharpened and which I don't recommend big graphic designer like. 
02:28
I don't like it too much because it makes the image a little bit distorted.
02:36
You can always increase the clarity, but don't do it too much and the best thing that you can do is smoothen it because that gives a natural effect to your image. 
02:48
Blurring will blur the image. 
02:49
Green will also add a kind of effect that is similar to sharpen but in a uniform way.
02:57
Vigilante will help in having aesthetic beauty.
03:03
Glamour will give it a little bit black effect. 
03:07
Bloom will increase the brightness and make it like it's blooming.
03:12
The haze will decrease the brightness.
03:17
Then we have Dawning. 
03:18
So basically in this, if you choose a particular colour, let's say I'm choosing.
03:25
This color or let's just change it so whichever color you choose the image would have the toning of that color that you can see right now. 
03:35
And shadows will also help in giving the same color color. 
03:39
Shadows filled will fill the colour in the entire image.
03:44
Like you can see right now and then that's where we have the help of blend modes. 
03:51
Let's them choosing this orange shade. 
03:53
Then I have this blend mode, I can change it to screen overlay, multiply anything that I want. 
04:00
And the best thing that I really like is you could compare the image.
04:06
This was it before and this it is now. 
04:09
So we have learned a lot in adding the filtering effects. 
04:12
Don't do too much. 
04:14
I was just teaching you how to add it. 
04:17
Make it look unique and make it look just as natural it is. 
04:21
And then if you don't like it, you can reset it as well.
04:26
But if you like it, you can apply. 
04:29
So I'm going to click upon apply. 
04:31
There you go, a better version of the image is ready. 


As we're done with the layers, we'll be starting a little bit of editing. 
00:06
Now the first thing that I'm going to teach you is cropping. 
00:10
So if you come to the side toolbar here that's on the left hand side, you have different kind of options. 
00:16
So for cropping, you have this option here that says crop and rotate.
00:21
They click upon crop and rotate.
00:24
Here and you can see the aspect has been selected already and then you can drag to the place you want to crop the image.
00:35
And then click upon apply.
00:38
And then you can undo if you did something wrong. 
00:43
Also here you can rotate the image in whichever direction and flip it in horizontal and vertical.

Moving ahead, we'll be learning about effects. 
00:03
This is the option under adjusting filter here. 
00:06
And you have different kind of effects that you can choose from. 
00:10
Like we have a sub topic for each effect. 
00:13
Like we have friends who aren't, like we have the name given for each friend like we have Harry.
00:20
Ideas in effect here. 
00:22
If you choose Lucas, behalf, the effect of Lucas, if you choose Sophia, Sophia's effect, and many more. 
00:29
You can also do control C if you don't want those effects.
00:37
Then we have two old which is having the older effects that we had in the black and white movies.
00:45
The my post favorite is the end stage because they have the most subtle and aesthetic effects and one of my favorite is Carl, which you can see matches really well with the image.
00:59
So all you have to do is keep on exploring more and more.

Next we have text. 
00:02
That option is this one, so click upon text. 
00:06
You can also add text which are ready made here. 
00:09
You cannot use the premium version until you've paid for it. 
00:14
And the ones which don't have the crown icon, you can use them. 
00:19
So let's say I'm using.
00:21
Now showing.
00:23
You can also edit the text, change it, change the font and change the style and add any other thing to it. 
00:32
But if you want to add your own text, click upon Add text and click upon Add new text.
00:41
Here would be writing, let's say mountain.
00:49
We can increase the size by dragging it outward and then you can see this is the margins that can let you know that you have the X central line. 
01:01
Now we have the font here as well. 
01:04
You can only choose the fonts.
01:06
Which are not premium.
01:11
And also you can add your own font if you wish to. 
01:15
So I'm going to be adding one of my favorite fonts, that's Claudia Blood. 
01:20
Next you can fill it with different colours. 
01:22
I feel that is good enough, so I'm going to keep it as it is here as well. 
01:28
You can decrease the opacity to make it look good.
01:32
And also merge with the background. 
01:35
Also increase or decrease the size, increase the line spacing, decrease it.
01:42
As well as increase letter spacing or decrease it. 
01:46
Next we have the text alignment for left align, center align or right align. 
01:52
We have uppercase, italics and bold.
01:57
The last four options are of curves, so if you want to add a curve you can increase it and you can see it's getting curved in front of an arc if I move ahead to a circle.
02:14
That's how it looked like.
02:18
Next we have half that'll make a semicircle.
02:25
If you take it towards this side, it'll go down and then make an arc.
02:33
Then we can also add background to it if you want, but I don't think that's necessary. 
02:39
So let's take it off outline it will give it an outlining.
02:44
And then it can also add shadows, so that's all for text. 

Next we have the drawing tool that is the last option before the three dots. 
00:06
So click upon draw. 
00:08
Here you can see that you can draw with a brush tool, eraser, pen tool and shape. 
00:15
The brush tool you have to basically increase or decrease the pixel amount softness.
00:20
As well, like how soft you want to breathe and how hard you want it to be. 
00:26
Softness would give her daily soft effect and no softness would make it like a circle.
00:33
And then we had the transparency that how much light and dark you on the brush to be next he can choose the color. 
00:40
So let's say I want to add a little bit of effect of purple here where you go, Celine.
00:49
And they can give a smiley as well.
00:53
And also these are used when you have to add some touch ups to the image wherein the colors are a little bit mixed up. 
01:02
Eraser will erase the image as you can see and if you want to erase properly you can see you can scroll in and then erase the path that you don't want.
01:15
Next is the pen tool here and you can increase the size of the pen anything.
01:22
Then you have the effects and here it is. 
01:26
Well you can increase the amount and opacity that is transparency again as Paula has changed the color. 
01:34
Lastly, we have drawing with shapes here and we have square, circle, triangle, star, heart and 9:00.
01:43
If you want the shapes to have fill in between, that means there should be filled entirely with the color chosen. 
01:50
You can do that. 
01:51
If you remove the fill then basically there won't be any colour. 
01:55
Make sure that you have the colour already chosen and the fill mode is on. 
02:00
Also you can outline it with any color.
02:03
Let me choose Corey Sudan has been outlined. 
02:06
So if we have to add call outs of square or circle, this can be very helpful for you.

After understanding the interface, let us Start learning that how can we create our first project. 
00:09
So as you can see, I have downloaded the app and I have the Pixler X app. 
00:16
So in these courses we'll be learning about the Pixler X so.
00:22
To create a new project you can see you have this plus icon that says Open image or you can also click here. 
00:30
So if you want to create a project that starts with opening an image you can go ahead for that option. 
00:38
Otherwise you also have an option of creating a new without any image.
00:43
That blank template click on create new herein you can choose the sizing of your canvas. 
00:50
So like we have thumbnail, we have wide art grid so he'll pull so his story and then we also have certain options of Instagram story YouTube you can go ahead and.
01:04
Explore, but if you want the default that is 1920 width and 1080 height you can go ahead for that.
01:14
Then you can also give a name to your project. 
01:17
So let me give it as demo.
01:22
Next option here is background. 
01:24
So background basically means it will provide you the white background over which you can create your things. 
01:31
Otherwise if you want it to be a blank screen, you can disable the option and then click on create and that's how the screen would look like.
01:44
If you want to start by creating with open image, if you click on the option of this plus icon here or open image, you can choose any image that you want. 
01:54
So let's I'm going to choose this one and I click on open it'll ask me an option of creating new or add current. 
02:02
That is because I have.
02:04
Already made a project and if I click upon add current, this image would be added to that blank project. 
02:12
But if I want to create new then it will make a new project. 
02:17
So let's click upon create new and here you go. 
02:20
You have your image and that's how we create our project.

Before we learn how to save the image, we can also add animation to the images. 
00:06
So click upon animation and have your text layer clicked so if you click upon it you can see the preview how it looked like.
00:17
Tumble with give this effect. 
00:19
Soothe will give this effect.
00:23
Action will give this effect and these weaken. 
00:26
Unfortunately not use, but they look cool.
00:33
So let's use.
00:36
Rise, I think this looks cool. 
00:38
So after we're done, we'll learn how to save the image exported. 
00:44
So click upon save here and you can also save an image. 
00:49
So I'm going to save a JPG and click upon Save as after saving.
00:55
The JPG I'm also going to save the animation MP4. 
00:59
You can choose the frame rate and the size. 
01:02
You can also make it a GIF if you want. 
01:06
So I'm going to be using an MP4 for now and click upon save as and now. 
01:13
It will be working for some time, depends upon.
01:16
How big it is, how many characters that you have, layers that you have, and it'll take a little bit time to save.
01:26
Yep, done. 
01:26
So that was all for our Pixar beginner series. 
01:30
Hope you enjoyed learning. 
01:32
We'll be back soon with more great tutorials for you. 
01:37
Thank you.


Now we'll be learning about how to add some elements and images. 
00:05
O if you come to this option, underneath the text option, we have add element or image here and you can search for some elements. 
00:14
So let's I'm going to search for some shapes.
00:19
Enter here. 
00:19
And again, you can only choose if you don't have a premium account, the ones which are not having the crown icon on them. 
00:30
So let's go ahead for Bahamian geometry, if that's how you pronounce it. 
00:35
And let's see, I like this one.
00:39
Let's take it.
00:43
And we can add it at the sides to make it have a beautiful effect.
00:51
So let's add that at the corner. 
00:54
Yep, now it looks cool. 
00:55
So I've added a few elements. 
00:57
You can also go ahead and search for them. 
01:00
And next, you can also add images, so you can browse through your own file section. 
01:06
Or go ahead searching for more and more elements here. 

Moving on, we have merging, duplicating and deleting off layers. 
00:06
So first of all I'm going to talk about merging.
00:12
Again, if you come to the lesser things, you have this option of merge down. 
00:17
Now that means that let's say you have 10 less and you click upon the layer settings of the first layer that you see and you click upon merge down, then that layer would only be combined to the layer beneath it.
00:32
Like this these two have been merged. 
00:35
You can also do control C or the undo option to bring it back again. 
00:40
Then you have merge visible. 
00:42
So this would make the layer logged and then you have flattened image. 
00:47
So in this way even if you have 10 layers or even more.
00:52
That all of them would be combined as one layer. 
00:56
So if I explain that to you by explaining duplicating or flares, you have this option of duplicate layer. 
01:03
You click upon that and you can see you can make many more duplicates.
01:09
Also Control C, control V will also work. 
01:12
If I click upon flatten image all of them have been flattened. 
01:16
But if I click upon merge down then only one of them works. 
01:21
And finally we have the lighting. 
01:24
There are two ways are there, click upon the leaked layer or you can.
01:29
On Tuesday delete key.


Now we were learning about the effect of locking and hiding affairs. 
00:05
So if you come again to the layer settings, you have this option of logged and visible. 
00:11
So if I unlock the layer, that means now I can add effects to it, I can move it around, I can.
00:20
Increase and decrease the size and add a little bit more touch ups to it if it's locked. 
00:26
There's certain things that I cannot do and now the image is unlocked.
00:32
Next we have this option of visible and hidden so tight. 
00:36
Now it's on visible. 
00:37
So this feature basically helps in showing and hiding the layer. 
00:41
If I click upon hidden, the image won't be shown any more. 
00:46
And these tools are really beneficial when we have to work on a certain layer.
00:52
But you don't want to delete it. 
00:54
You can just click on hidden and then you can work on a specific layer and bravo, you can bring it back again by clicking upon visible.

So after you are signed up, we'll be learning about the interface of Pixel.
00:08
So first of all, the two main things that we haven't picked them is Pixlr X and Pixler E Pixler X is used for designing a project wherein you need to design some photos, you need to edit some photos and provide it a beautiful effect.
00:29
Fix their E is an advanced editor. 
00:32
You can call it another version of Photoshop wherein you can start a photo editing project from scratch and then after you have eluded that photo, you can add that picture X and basically beautify the photo. 
00:48
So you have this option here.
00:51
At the top right corner we have these three web apps Pixlr ex and Remove BG. 
00:57
Remove BG is used for removing background of an image. 
01:01
So if you don't want to start moving the background on your own and you want the AI feature in it, you can use Remove PG and that is really helpful.
01:12
For you here and you can go ahead for the pricing and free trial. 
01:17
So this account is on free trial. 
01:20
So if you want to upgrade to the pro version, you can pay and get the pricing, the paid version.
01:28
He also have desktop apps for Pixela. 
01:31
So here's one downloaded for Pixlr X and that's how it looked like. 
01:36
Then we also have stories by Pixler. 
01:38
With this you can make Instagram stories and different kind of videos but this is the mobile apps you have to use it on your phone. 
01:48
Next we have.
01:49
Some other services such as Pixar Dynasties which is used for making beautiful art structures in form of images then we have stock by Pixler. 
01:59
Here you can find some images provided by Pixlr themselves and you also have some ready made templates which you can use under that.
02:09
We also have some video tutorials. 
02:11
This directs you to the YouTube channel of Pixela. 
02:15
It's really helpful learn and education. 
02:17
Here you can find out about some help supports if you aren't care about something and if there's some fault with the website and you are facing some issues, you can.
02:29
Always click on Contact and Support.
02:33
And that basically is the interface of pixlr.

Hi everyone, today we'll be learning about photo editing, animation and designing app called Pixlr which is the number one app in photosynthetic and designing tools wherein you can edit photos and create stunning designs right in your browser on your phone.
00:21
By your desktop and guess what? 
00:23
For free. 
00:24
So we can start from an empty canvas, make a photo, design anything that we want from our imagination.
00:33
For the first thing to start with, photo editing with Pixlr, you have to get signed up. 
00:41
So search for pixlr.com with an X in between.
00:46
Then you have this option that says Sign up, login. 
00:52
Click on that.
00:55
And then you can either log in from sign up from Google, Facebook, your Apple ID, or you can use your own e-mail ID with the passport with it. 
01:06
And you may also choose the country of origin and then sign up. 
01:11
If you already have an account, click on log in here.
01:16
And now I'm logged in in my account.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the third video with Jeannie. 
00:11
So today I'm going to tell you how to blink an LED using Arduino Uno. 
00:16
That is our microcontroller. 
00:17
So for that thing you need Walkway, which is an online simulator.
00:21
For Arduino, ESP, Raspberry Pi and so many microcontrollers. 
00:25
So I'm just going to give you a brief introduction about Walkway. 
00:29
So Walkway is the online simulation platform designed for electronics to programming to develop, simulate and test their microcontrollers projects without the need for physical hardware. 
00:39
So suppose if you are.
00:42
You are attending online classes to know how to use Arduino ESP and Raspberry Pi, so you can use walkway for simulations. 
00:51
It is a practically popular for prototyping Arduino ESP 32, Raspberry Pi and other electronic projects. 
00:57
So here I'm going to give you a little description.
01:02
So first I will click so you will see the interface here you will find out do you know Uno, Mega and Nino also ESP 32 STM 32 Pipico. 
01:12
OK so now on first of all the feature of work we are online circuit simulator. 
01:17
So walkway is a browser based simulator meaning you can use it directly.
01:22
From your web browser, no matter you are using Microsoft Edge, Safari or Chrome. 
01:27
First of all it is a free open source. 
01:31
Then it provide a virtual environment for building circuits using drag and drop components like microcontrollers, sensors, LEDs, resistors, motors and many more. 
01:40
Then support for multiple microcontrollers because we have.
01:44
But you know Uno, Mega, Nano, ESP 32, Raspberry Pi, Pico, everything in one software which is free. 
01:50
And it is free of course. 
01:52
The biggest advantage we can say then real time code simulation walk. 
01:56
We allow user to write and upload code to the virtual call microcontroller and the simulator will run it as if it were.
02:04
One user can code in languages like Arduino, RC Micro, Python And other supported by specific microcontrollers. 
02:14
Then we have components library. 
02:16
Walkway features a rich library of electronic components including sensor temperature.
02:24
Distance sensors and everything. 
02:26
Then we have also 7 segment displays here. 
02:28
OK so now I will show you how exactly what we interface look like. 
02:33
So you will see on the left hand side you have to write code and everything and on the right hand side you will see the simulations then it.
02:43
Is an interactive environment because user can connect component just by clicking and dragging. 
02:49
So you will see I just click on the LED.
02:55
And it was there. 
02:56
I just need to drag and drop anywhere I want it and I can also change the colors of my LED as per my requirement. 
03:03
Then we have many debugging tools like serial monitor, OK variable inspections and logins. 
03:06
So if you have any error in your code, it will show a red line over here and you will let you know OK what exactly the problem is.
03:15
Then the most biggest advantage I'm talking about is free and premium version. 
03:20
So Walk free offers a free version with access to most of the basic components and microcontrollers. 
03:27
But if you have a premium version, you will also assess the additional components and few simulation with complex projects.
03:36
Then.
03:38
I'm going to now tell you how you will blink an LED using microcontroller board with one LED. 
03:44
So sure the components we need is a blue Arduino Uno board and one LED any color you want. 
03:51
So I like red color. 
03:53
So I will just buy default change the color then I need now.
03:58
The most biggest question is where are the jumper wires? 
04:01
You didn't need any jumper wire. 
04:03
You just need to click over here and you have a jumper wire of any color you want. 
04:09
OK so before adding my jumper wires to anywhere first I will do this. 
04:13
I will make connections so you will see this one is a note and the another one.
04:19
Anode is positive, cathode is negative. 
04:22
So I'm going to place my pin on the pin number seven. 
04:27
Then I'm going to place the cathode on.
04:32
Ground.
04:35
Which is negative. 
04:36
Now I need to.
04:40
Code my LED as per my choice, how it will work and everything.
04:50
I write my code before so you will see the first line which is in LED pin.
04:59
So basically you will see LED has two LEDs is anode and C is cathode. 
05:04
As I told you A is positive and C is negative. 
05:08
So what you have to do you will see there is I have written int LED pin equals to 13 so I need to delete 13 and I have to write 7 because.
05:19
My pin number is 7. 
05:21
Fine. 
05:21
We don't need to declare any GND pin because we are putting negative on the negative. 
05:28
So what is int here? 
05:30
Int is integer basically then this line defined LED pin as the variable holding the value of the pin connected to the LED.
05:39
So in case we have pin number 7 is used. 
05:43
So that's why you will see key int is hold LED pin is holding value of seven of this microcontroller board.
05:53
Then we have void setup pin mode, LED pin, output. 
05:57
In this setup function we use pin mode to the set LED pin as an output pin because we need output from the LED. 
06:07
Once our LED will flow, I make sure Kia my microcontroller board is working.
06:13
My code is fine. 
06:15
So this tell the Arduino pin Arduino that pin 7 will be used to send signal either it's high or low. 
06:23
High means on, low means off. 
06:26
Then we have void loop. 
06:28
So you will see digital pin LED pin high delay 1000 so.
06:34
The digital right function is used to set the state of the pin which is high. 
06:40
High means it sent 5 Volt to the LED to turn it on. 
06:44
Then we have delay 1000. 
06:46
The function pauses the program for 1000 milliseconds. 
06:48
That means one second you will replace it as per your choice. 
06:52
Then we have digital pin LED.
06:55
Then, low. 
06:55
That means setting the pin to the low sends 0 Volt. 
06:59
You turning the LED off, delay 1000 again. 
07:02
Again we pause for one second because we need our LED will glow for one second and remain off for one second. 
07:10
The loop function will keep remaining indefinitely while causes to LED to turn.
07:15
Or and of continuously with the one second interval. 
07:19
Thank you so much as I'll show you the simulation.
07:24
So it was tight. 
07:26
Start compiling my project and you will see how it's working.
07:31
Thank you so much. 
07:32
Stay tuned for next videos. 

Hello everyone, welcome in today's video. 
00:09
So today I'm going to tell you how to use LCD with I2C in Arduino Uno. 
00:15
So as you know LCD is a popular way to display information.
00:20
An embedded system like the Arduino Uno. 
00:22
The most common type used in Arduino project is the 16 into 2 LCD which has 16 columns and two rows, meaning it can display up to 32 character at once. 
00:34
LCD's are great for providing a visual output for data such as sensor reading, project status.
00:40
Or user interface. 
00:41
However, wiring up an LCD directly to the Arduino can require a lot of connection, typically around 12 pens, including those for data control and power. 
00:52
This can be cumbersome, especially for more complex projects where you need to save space on your Arduino.
01:00
Solve this issue. 
01:01
We use an I2C that means Inter integrated circuit module with the LCD. 
01:06
I2C is the communication protocol that allow you to connect multiple devices using just two wires, SDA which is data line and SCL that is clock line. 
01:16
With an I2C adapter we can reduce the number of pins.
01:20
Required to connect an SSD to just 4 pins, VCC, GND, SDA and SCL. 
01:27
Now I'm going to show you how you can use LCD with Arduino Uno.
01:39
So you can see this is the code for our LCD. 
01:43
So first I can just drag my Arduino little down and I'm going to choose LCD 1622-I2C. 
01:51
As you can see we have 4 pins, the first one.
01:55
G&D which is supposed to be in G and done the second pin we have VCC which is supposed to be on 5 Volt.
02:08
Done. 
02:08
The third one is SDA. 
02:11
So remember always SDN SCL pins are supposed to be connected with analog pins. 
02:17
So SDA is supposed to connected with A4.
02:23
An SCL is supposed to be connected with.
02:29
A5.
02:32
So now I'm going to start my simulation. 
02:35
As for you can see here's written hashtag include wire hashtag include liquid crystal I2C. 
02:43
That means we have to install these two LEDs in walkway to start the simulation. 
02:50
So now I'm going to.
02:52
Start my simulation.
02:55
So you can sort of see it was still compiling my project.
03:00
OK, so now finally it shows me an error that shows key. 
03:04
I have to install this library. 
03:06
So install liquid crystal I2C library.
03:10
Installing is done, going back to my sketch again. 
03:13
Going to start the simulation. 
03:15
So as you can see it was showing hello on the LCD. 
03:19
In this way you can print anything you want so I will show you a different text.
03:27
Which is Viz Robo.
03:34
Prepared future ready children's.
03:43
I'm going to start the simulation.
03:53
So you can see this this LCD is only able to write or show 32 characters at a time. 
04:00
So I have written so mistakes that's why it was not showing me this text in a proper way.
04:07
So I can just what I can do. 
04:10
I can remove my text and I can again start the simulation to see what exactly output my SD is giving.
04:21
So it was showing me where's Robo. 
04:24
Thank you so much. 
04:25
Stay tuned for the next video.

Hello everyone, welcome back to our next video. 
00:10
So in this video I'm going to tell you how to connect server motor with Arduino Uno. 
00:15
So we can just click on WOKV and we are going to choose our Arduino.
00:20
Ohh no.
00:22
See here we have written Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, Dano 80, Tiny 85 and many more micro controllers but the one we need is Arduino Uno. 
00:32
First. 
00:32
I will just delete this code.
00:36
And I'm just going to play servo motors quote over here. 
00:40
So because we are using server motor today so I need only server motor not any LED. 
00:45
So I'm just going to drag my server mode on little right side and add one or two left side. 
00:51
So it will just create some space for us as you can see.
00:55
We have three wires in our servomotor. 
00:58
The first one is a PWM pin. 
01:01
That means we can we can connect this this this wire to any pin like 356910 and 11. 
01:08
These are pulse with modulation pins. 
01:10
The next we have 5 Volt so we are going to connect this pin.
01:16
To the 5 Volt. 
01:17
Then the third one brown wire we have is ground, so that means this one is the negative wire. 
01:22
So first I'm going to connect the wires.
01:25
Ground is supposed to go with GND.
01:29
5 Volt is supposed to go with 5 Volt.
01:34
And I can choose PWM pin 9. 
01:36
So you can see there is one black wire and two green wire. 
01:41
Why? 
01:41
Because the green wires are positive ones. 
01:44
The one is going with 5 Volt and another one is a pin pin wire. 
01:49
But the black 1 is a ground wire that means negative. 
01:52
It's why so we can.
01:54
Make difference between green and black wire so they change the colors. 
01:59
OK, now I'm coming back to the code. 
02:02
The first line is #includes server dot. 
02:04
So this line includes the server library which contains function to control the server motor. 
02:10
Then we have void setup which is my server dot attach 9.
02:14
Ohh, this function attached the server motor to pin 9 on Arduino. 
02:18
As you can see I have connected my server with Arduino using 9 pin. 
02:23
Then we have void loop. 
02:25
So in the loop the four loop move the server from zero to 180° back and with a small delay to allow the server to reach each puja.
02:35
Smoothly. 
02:35
So as you know, we put delay to just do our server mode or even our LED's high and low. 
02:42
So I'm going to start the simulation.
02:46
Can see those compiling my project and it was giving us a error. 
02:51
A smooth error. 
02:52
So you will see what error it was giving us. 
02:55
Key hashtag include server compilation, terminated error during build. 
02:59
That means we didn't have any library with this name. 
03:02
As I told you before sometimes we need to download.
03:06
Two libraries in our Arduino ID or either we are using vocally. 
03:10
So first I'm going to install server library. 
03:13
For this I have to go there. 
03:15
I need to click here.
03:19
So you can see. 
03:21
So now it's downloaded again, I'm going to library dot text sketch, sketch dot you know. 
03:28
So I'm going to again starting the simulation.
03:35
So as you can see server motor is working because now we have server library in our walkway. 
03:41
So in this way you can download libraries just by one click. 
03:45
Thank you so much. 
03:47
Stay tuned for the next video. 

Hello everyone, welcome back to the West Genie videos again. 
00:11
So today I'm going to tell you how to download different libraries or I can say how to install different libraries in Arduino ID. 
00:19
So you will.
00:20
You can seiki today we we are not using pork we we are using Arduino IDE which is the Arduino software we use for Arduino Uno or ESP also. 
00:32
So basically this software is in built with C language language. 
00:36
So as you know OK Arduino is compatible with.
00:40
C++. 
00:41
That's why we are using our Juno IDE because Walkway has already preinstalled libraries. 
00:47
That's why we are doing this topic on Arduino IDE software today. 
00:53
So first I love to tell you about the Arduino IDE software, OK?
01:02
Hi, how are you know ID works? 
01:04
What is the uses of or do you know ID and everything? 
01:09
OK, so I'm going to start the video today and in the last I'm going to tell you how you will download more LEDs using Arduino IDE library system. 
01:19
So Arduino IDE is integrated development.
01:22
Environment is the official software used to write, compile and upload code to an Arduino board. 
01:27
It is user friendly and designed to facilitate the process of programming microcontrollers, particularly for beginners in electronics and embedded systems. 
01:35
So what are the key features of Arduino ID? 
01:38
Simple and easy to use interface as you can see.
01:42
The interface is very simple and easy. 
01:44
ID has a straightforward beginner friendly interface that allow user to focus on writing code without giving bog down to complex settings or configuration. 
01:52
So I will show you just I just need to click on the file as I will click on the new sketch.
02:01
It will show me an interface like this. 
02:03
So I hope you remembered the code we have done with the LED so you will see again it was the same interface as WASP. 
02:12
Then it have code writing and editing. 
02:14
So you can write code in CC with builtin functions that are easy to understand such as digital right?
02:21
Digital read delay, void setup, void loop. 
02:24
Then the editor provide features like highlighting errors, color-coded syntax and code compilation to help identify mistakes. 
02:31
Also then we have prebuilt functions and libraries as I told you. 
02:35
OK, today we are learning how to download or how to install libraries in IDE.
02:42
But most of the libraries are preinstalled in Arduino ID compiling and uploading. 
02:48
After writing the code first we did verify our code OK.
02:56
We verify the code after writing it it converting it into machine language that can be understood by the microcontroller. 
03:04
Once compiled the upload button upload the code to the Arduino board via USB connection. 
03:10
Then we have serial monitor. 
03:12
The serial monitor allow user to debug.
03:15
Can interact with the Arduino board during program execution. 
03:18
It shows data sent from the bolt such as sensor readings. 
03:22
Allow you to send commands to the board from your computer. 
03:25
OK then we have the sketch book. 
03:28
As you can see this is our sketchbook where we can write our code as per our requirement. 
03:34
Then we have.
03:35
Library Manager.
03:38
You will see its board manager, library manager, everything. 
03:42
Then we also have a search option and we have a debugging. 
03:47
So basically debugging is not supported by Arduino Uno and we have not connected Arduino Uno yet. 
03:54
OK, so now I'm going to tell you how to install libraries.
04:00
In Arduino IDE.
04:13
So I'm going back to the my first course. 
04:16
It is a so you will see here I have a code of LED basically. 
04:22
Basically it's a metal sensor code where I have used a server motor. 
04:27
So you will see what will happen if I have not.
04:33
Download the libraries of server motor. 
04:35
What exactly the output it will give me. 
04:38
So this is the two basic.
04:42
Handle files we used for our servo motors. 
04:45
So first I will just click on the verify my code. 
04:49
So you will see it was showing an error which is a compilation error stapper dot H no such file or directory. 
04:57
Now why we don't have these types of directory because we have not installed any server.
05:02
Motor library in our computer or I can say in our PC OK and in the software. 
05:10
So what you have to do you have to.
05:15
You have to go to the library.
05:20
So as you can see I have right here #includes stepper and server. 
05:24
So now I'm going to verify first this code. 
05:27
So you will see see it was giving you error over here which is no such file or directory because I have not installed stepper in Arduino ID. 
05:37
So now how I can download this?
05:40
Library in my in my audio no idea I have to click on the library manager as I have to write step. 
05:48
So you will see there are so many things stepper by Arduino, Arduino Android 2. 
05:53
So I want this one the first one I do know by ID I will just click on the install it successfully.
06:00
Install Library Stepper. 
06:02
So how in this way you will download any library in your Arduino IDE. 
06:07
Thank you so much. 
06:09
Stay tuned for the next review.

Hello everyone, welcome back to the second video of Vizzini in which in this video I'm going to tell you about the microcontroller board which is Arduino Uno so you can see this blue board.
00:20
Which is Arduino Uno. 
00:22
Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board based on 80 Mega 3289. 
00:27
So basically it is known for its simple manufacturing structure and also its versatility in prototyping and projects. 
00:35
So it has a total of 28 pins categorized into digital.
00:40
Input, output pins, analog input pins and power pins. 
00:43
So I'm going to tell you about each and every pin in descriptive way. 
00:49
So first I'll start with the digital pin. 
00:52
So you can see there is zero to 13 digital pins and you will see a specific sign on few pins like 35691011.
01:00
Which is digital PWM pins. 
01:02
So pins zero to 1313 are digital input output pins that can be used for both input and output operations. 
01:11
Pin zero and one are also used for serial communication, which is receiver and transmission. 
01:17
Each pin can supply and receive a maximum of 40.
01:21
For me which is mega imperial then pin 35691011 RBWM that's mint power pulse with modulation pins. 
01:29
They are capable which mean they can provide analog like output using the analog write function. 
01:36
So we will learn about analog write function in our next videos.
01:42
Now next we have analog pins which started from A0 to A5. 
01:47
So you can see a zero to A5 are analog input pins that can read analog signal using analog read function. 
01:55
These pins have a resolution of 10 bits meaning that they can read values between 0.
02:02
And 1023, they can also be used as digital pin if necessary. 
02:07
Each analog pin can also act as a general purpose digital pin allowing more flexibility. 
02:14
Then we have power pins. 
02:16
You can see we have 12345678 power pins. 
02:20
So the first one is VIN.
02:23
Which is This pin is used to supply input voltage to the Arduino board. 
02:27
It can be used to provide external power in the range of 7 to 12 volts. 
02:33
Then we have 5 Volt. 
02:35
This pin provide regulated 5 Volt output. 
02:37
It is used to power external components like motor driver, IR sensors and ultrasonic sensors.
02:43
And we have 3.3 Volt. 
02:44
This pin provider regulated 3.3 Volt output which can be used to power low voltage components. 
02:50
Then we have G and so in our microcontroller board you can see there are 3G and D2 on power pins and one on digital pins. 
03:00
So GND is ground the Arduino Uno.
03:03
Has several ground pins, usually 3 or 4 used for common ground connection. 
03:07
Ground means negative connections. 
03:08
Then we have a reset column. 
03:10
Also this pin can be used to reset the board. 
03:13
By applying a low signal to this pin, the board is reset. 
03:17
So suppose if you are you have an old cold in your microcontroller board so you want it to reset that.
03:23
Code you should press that red button or you can just send a low power signal to the reset board so it will reset the whole code provided by someone else. 
03:36
Before then we have some special function pins which are Aref that means analog reference. 
03:42
This pin is used to.
03:44
Provider reference voltage for the analog input. 
03:46
It is used with analog reference function. 
03:49
Then we have reset button, the red button. 
03:52
The button on the board can be pressed to reset the microcontroller restarting the code execution. 
03:58
Then we have IREF that means this pin provide the voltage reference at which the.
04:04
Macro control operate. 
04:05
That means the the microcontroller operate it typically 5 Volt voltage. 
04:09
It helps shield to adapt to the voltage of the bolts or bolt so that our microcontroller board cannot be burnt. 
04:18
Then we have pin mapping overview. 
04:20
What is pin mapping overview? 
04:22
Pin mapping overviews are 35.
04:24
69 and 1011 that means PWM pins. 
04:27
These are the power with modulation pins. 
04:30
Then we have UART pins that means serial collect connection zero and one zero is receiver, one is transmission. 
04:38
Then we have I2C pins also to connect LCD's which are A4 and A5.
04:44
It is the SDA and SDA SCL series serial data and serial communication. 
04:50
So then we have one port where you can power up your Arduino by.
05:00
Then we have two power pins which is you can see the silver one and the black one. 
05:05
The silver one we use to add Artino cable to upload code in this microcontroller port. 
05:10
The black one will use to power up our Arduino board. 
05:13
So sometimes 5 Volt or 12 Volt are not enough to give power to the microcontroller.
05:19
So we need some.
05:21
External power supply to give power to our board. 
05:24
That's why we use this port. 
05:26
Thank you so much. 
05:28
Stay tuned for the next video.

Hello everyone so today I'm going to tell you how to use IR sensor with Arduino Uno. 
00:15
But before I started I wanted to show you how infrared sensor that.
00:20
Things I sensor looks like in a real world. 
00:22
So you can see this is the real IR sensor. 
00:26
So IR sensor have two different LED's which are red in black so.
00:32
I sensor that means an infrared sensor is a device that detect infrared radiations to senses surroundings. 
00:38
It is commonly used for proximity and obstacle detection, line following and other applications requiring the detection of objects or motion. 
00:46
Is sensor consists of an IRL LED which emits infrared light and photo.
00:52
Or photo transistor that predicts the reflective light. 
00:55
When an object come close to the sensor, the infrared light bounces back and the photodiode detects it, providing an output signal. 
01:04
IR sensor are widely used in automation system, remote control applications and robotics due to their simplicity and.
01:12
Cost effectiveness. 
01:12
So yeah, we are going to open our walkway again to code our IR sensor with Arduino Uno.
01:26
Because we are using IR sensor in BOC V so we don't have a proper IR sensor here. 
01:32
So we have to use IR receiver.
01:36
I remote.
01:38
And one LED.
01:41
Because every online simulator have their own components, so we can work like this. 
01:47
So as you know we have two terminals on LED, one is the third one is keno cathode. 
01:55
So anode is supposed to go with 9.
02:02
And cathode is supposed to go with GNT.
02:05
Then we have an IR receiver. 
02:07
The first one is data. 
02:09
Data is supposed to go with two.
02:14
It is my choice to put all these pins into 911 anywhere. 
02:18
You can put it on any number of your choice. 
02:21
Then I'm going to put VCC on 5 Volt.
02:26
And then the last, I have to put ground on ground. 
02:29
So this time I'm not going to share my ground with any other pin, so I'm just going to put my ground over here. 
02:36
So now coming back to our code, the first one is constant in IR sensor pin two, it shows where you have put your IRS receivers pin. 
02:44
So that means you have.
02:46
Guitar IR sensor receiver pin on two then the next one is the LED pin. 
02:51
So I have put my LED's positive pin on 9 then invite setup. 
02:56
We need to define what exactly IR sensor is doing. 
02:59
An LED pain is doing so IR sensor is taking input and LED is showing the output of IRS sensor.
03:06
Then in void loop we have digital read for iOS sensor pin because IR sensor is taking input from the remote that's why we are using digital right here, digital read here. 
03:16
Then we have digital right for LED. 
03:19
That means when it was supposed to be low high it will turn on the LED and when we are clicking on the low.
03:26
Apple of the LED. 
03:28
So now I'm going to start the simulation.
03:34
So I can just click on the test so you will see the LED's glowing. 
03:40
Then I will click on 0123.
03:44
And then see and again test so you can sneak in. 
03:48
My IR sensor is working perfectly. 
03:50
So in this way you can learn IR sensor very easily. 
03:54
Thank you so much, Stay tuned for next video.  

Hello everyone.
00:09
Welcome back to the third video or short video of the Wiz Jenny. 
00:14
So today I'm going to tell you how you will make patterns of LED invoke we using Arduino Uno. 
00:20
So first I will click on the walkway. 
00:23
So because we are starting from the scratch, we will click on the Arduino. 
00:28
So as we need this.
00:30
Arduino Uno because we are using Arduino Uno in Virginia. 
00:33
This is our previous core. 
00:35
I just wanted to delete this one and we will see the code we have written before. 
00:41
So this time because we are using 3 LEDs so I'm going to.
00:47
Three LED's from the.
00:53
So the second step I will do, I will just change the color of all these three LEDs. 
00:59
So one I'm going to do purple, one I'm going to.
01:09
When I'm going to do orange and one is remaining red. 
01:14
So now I will tell you how you will disconnect these all these three.
01:21
Shift pins to the different different number. 
01:24
First I'm going to connect. 
01:26
Red one is to the 7, yellow 1 is going with eight and purple 1 is going with.
01:33
12.
01:37
Done. 
01:38
So now the main task is key we have to connect three LED's grounds. 
01:43
So you will see we have three GND on microcontroller board. 
01:47
But what will happen if we are using 6 LEDs? 
01:51
So from where we will get three more grounds so.
01:55
For with this simulation board, what you have to do, you will connect more than two or three LEDs ground with one single ground. 
02:03
This is the biggest advantage we have in online simulators. 
02:06
So you I will show you how you are going to do this.
02:12
1st I'm going to connect red LED's ground. 
02:15
The second one I'm going to connect orange LED is ground.
02:21
In the same ground pin and the 3rd I'm going to add is the purple pins ground in the same ground pin. 
02:30
Now we have to make few changes in our code because this time we are using tree LED so LED pin is 7. 
02:39
Then I have to give a new name.
02:43
To my secondary so I'm going to give it name LED pin 2.
02:50
And the number is 8.
02:54
Then the third LED.
02:58
LED pen 3.
03:01
Is on 12 number.
03:05
Done. 
03:05
Then we also have to make changes in the void setup because here we are asking for only one LED's output. 
03:11
So now I'm going to add pin mode.
03:17
It's LED pin to,output.
03:26
Then I'm going to add the same thing for the third LED spin mode, LED pin 3, output. 
03:32
Then we have to make changes in the void loop as well. 
03:37
So you will say there is the first setup of our first LED which is LED pin. 
03:43
So I'm going to make setup.
03:46
For the second LED digital right LED pin 2, hi.
03:56
2nd is delay.
04:00
So I'm going to put delay 100 Millis 1000 millisecond.
04:06
Then the next I have to put digital right follow also so it's LED pin.
04:15
2.
04:17
, low. 
04:19
Again, delay is important.
04:23
So it's delay.
04:26
1000.
04:38
I'm just leaving a few space in between all these codes so you are able to understand OK from which side new thing is started again? 
04:49
Digital right LED pin?
04:52
3.
04:54
, hi.
04:57
Then we have delay.
05:08
LED entry, low and the last one is.
05:19
Delete.
05:23
It's 1000 now I have to close the braces.
05:29
Done. 
05:30
So now my code is done. 
05:32
I need to see the pin numbers are right here 7812. 
05:35
Done, all pins are connected. 
05:37
So now I'm going to start the simulation. 
05:40
As you will see it is working or not.
05:45
12.
05:49
3 So you will see our code is working. 
05:52
Thank you so much. 
05:54
Stay tuned for next video.

Coughing.
00:08
Hello everyone, welcome back to with Jeannie. 
00:10
So today we are going to learn about ultrasonic sensor. 
00:13
So before I start, I wanted to show you how our ultrasonic sensor looks like. 
00:18
So you can see there are various types of ultrasonic sensors we used with Arduino Uno. 
00:24
So I'm going back to the walkway.
00:28
I'm going to choose Arduino Uno for today's code.
00:34
OK so before I start code my ultrasonic sensor I wanted to tell you about ultrasonic sensor, what exactly ultrasonic sensor do and everything. 
00:45
So ultrasonic sensor is a type of electronic sensor that measured the distance to an object by using ultrasonic sound waves. 
00:53
It consists of.
00:55
2 main components are transmitter detriments, ultrasonic pulses and a receiver that detects the reflective sound wave. 
01:02
When the transmitted pulse hits an object, it bounces back and the receiver detects it. 
01:09
The sensor calculate the distance to the object based on the time taken for.
01:15
The sound wave to return ultrasonic sensors are commonly used for obstacle avoidance, distance measurement and level detection in robotics, automation and various other applications, providing accurate distance readings even in environment with varying lighting conditions.
01:34
So this is the code for our ultrasonic sensor. 
01:37
So now I'm going to tell you what are the uses of these 4 pins. 
01:42
The first one is VCC, that means it's a positive pin. 
01:45
So we are supposed to connect our VCC with 5 Volt.
01:51
The next pin we have is GND, that means ground. 
01:54
We are going to connect this pin with ground, that means negative. 
01:59
Then we have trigger an eco pin. 
02:01
The trigger pin is the ultrasonic sensor which basically we are connecting this pin with the number 9 OK and then we have a.
02:10
Eco pin which is a digital pin also we are going to connect our eco pin with.
02:16
10.
02:19
So now coming back to our code. 
02:21
So you will see like I have written constant in trigger pin 9, constant in eco pin 10. 
02:27
So what does that mean? 
02:29
So define trigger and eco pins. 
02:31
The trigger pin and eco pin are set to digital pins 9 and 10 respectively. 
02:36
So now next we have.
02:38
To trigger our sensor that means we have to change the high and low capacity. 
02:44
So where we have to put A10 microsecond pulse for trigger pin and then same for the echo pin. 
02:51
Then it is used to calculate the distance. 

Hello everyone and welcome to today's video. 
00:11
If you were ever wanted to control the brightness of an LED's, adjust the speed of a motor or even create different audio tones.
00:20
Using an Arduino Uno, then you are in the right place. 
00:24
Today we are going to learn how we can use all these important features with our Arduino Uno with our PWM pins. 
00:33
Yes, you heard me correct you. 
00:35
I thought you remembered. 
00:36
I told you we have 6 PWM pins in Arduino.
00:40
Uno those are 356910 and 11. 
00:43
So all these pins are known as pulse width modulation pins. 
00:48
So the Arduino have 6 PWM pins 356910 and 11 which allow us to simulate analog output with a digital signal. 
00:58
These pins are key to making your project.
01:01
More dynamic and versatile from lighting up the LED to controlling servo. 
01:07
Now I'm going to explain each and everything about PWM pins, how those PWM pins work. 
01:15
So the Arduino board have total 14 digital pins, but we have 6 PWM.
01:21
Means which are special pins for Arduino Uno. 
01:25
PWM pins are crucial for controlling devices that required a range of values instead of a simple on off state such as adjusting the brightness of an LED, controlling the speed of a bio motor or creating analog like output for audio signals.
01:42
The PWM pins can be identified.
01:46
By the tilt symbol marked next to pin number on the Arduino board. 
01:51
As you can see we have a different symbols on our few digital pins like 356910 and 11. 
01:58
Now what is PWM? 
01:59
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. 
02:01
It is a method used by microcontroller to create an average.
02:06
Voltage that appears analog. 
02:07
The idea is to turn a digital signal on and off repeatedly to generate a square wave by varying the proportion of time the signal is on versus off. 
02:19
You can change the output also, for example if the signal is on for 5060% of the time.
02:26
And off for 50% of the time, you get a 50% duty cycle, which represent an average output voltage of about 2.5 Volt when the supply voltage is 5 Volt. 
02:38
If the duty cycle is 25%, the average voltage would be approximately 1.25 V if the duty cycle is 75%.
02:47
The average voltage would be about 3.75 Volt. 
02:50
This technique allowed the Arduino to approximate analog output even though it is a digital device that can only output high 5 Volt or low 0 Volt signals. 
03:01
Now how to use PWM pins on the Arduino Uno in the Arduino programming language you.
03:07
Can use with analog write function to generate a PWM signal on any of the PWM pins. 
03:14
The analog write function take two parameters, the pin number. 
03:18
You want to output the Speedway signal to a value between 0 and 255, where 0 represents 0 duty cycle and 25.
03:27
Five represent 100% duty cycle. 
03:30
Now what is duty cycle? 
03:32
Duty cycle means 0% duty cycle is always off and 100% duty cycle is always on. 
03:38
We have various kinds of application of PWM pens. 
03:42
The first one is light brightness control. 
03:45
Using PWM pin you can control.
03:48
The brightness of an LED's. 
03:49
The higher the duty cycle the brighter the LED will appear. 
03:54
Motor speed control. 
03:55
You can also use PWM pin to control the speed of bio motor. 
03:59
By adjusting the duty cycle you can make the motor run slower or more faster. 
04:05
Audio signal generation. 
04:06
PWM can be used to create.
04:08
Found by generating various frequencies. 
04:11
By changing the duty cycle and frequency you can create different audio tunes. 
04:16
Servo motor control PWM pin can also use to control server motors which require specific PWM pins to set their positions.
04:29
Thank you so much. 
04:30
Stay tuned for the next video.
04:34
Hello everyone, so I told you OK how we can use PWM pins in various different ways. 
04:40
So now I'm going to show you an example of PWM pins through walkway. 
04:45
As you know walkway is a free of cost open source for us to use Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pie, ESP 32 and so many new things.
04:54
So first I'm going to delete this previous course.
04:57
So you can see this is the code for LED blinking with Arduino Uno using PWM pins. 
05:03
So first I have to take one LED.
05:08
As you can see I have written int LED pin equals to 9 here. 
05:13
So I have to put a nod of LED to 9 which is a PWM pin. 
05:18
The second step is I have to connect the negative of LED to G&D of Arduino Uno.
05:27
So now coming back to my code you can see invoice setup. 
05:31
I have written pin mode LED output as you all know is giving output here using the PWM pin. 
05:37
So in void loop I wanted to tell you about analog write which is LED pin 128. 
05:43
Now what does it mean? 
05:45
It means key 128.
05:46
Is that half of 255? 
05:48
So it is a duty cycle which is helping us to turn on the LED. 
05:53
The another analog right with 0, it shows a square LED will remain off for one second. 
05:59
So now I'm going to start the simulation.  

Hello everyone. 
00:14
Uh, in the last two classes, we learned how to create our own video using the characters, text effects and innovations available in power tool. 
00:25
In today's class, we will be learning to edit an existing template in power. 
00:30
So on the very first page you can see that.
00:35
There are various templates available in the cloud. 
00:38
These are pre designed templates which we can edit ourselves according to us. 
00:43
So for that I'm going to take any one dentium template and edit it. 
00:49
So for that purpose first I need to go on this more templates.
00:55
Motion.
00:57
And.
00:59
Now I have to choose a category for the template I want to edit.
01:04
Suppose I am going with a personal category and here I'm going like special events.
01:17
So we are very various, you know, templates I can use, I can edit.
01:26
OK.
01:28
I can also go with the holidays.
01:33
Happy holidays, Happy birthday. 
01:34
If I want to wish someone birthday, I don't need to create a whole video, I can just edit it according to myself and use it.
01:47
OK, so this is a template Happy Independence Day America. 
01:51
I'm going to use it. 
01:52
For those who are using my version of Powtoon template. 
01:55
It will be available here only. 
01:57
And if you kind of find it, you can search it over here in the search icon by typing Happy Independence Day America and this template will appear on your screen.
02:08
Now there comes two options, preview and use. 
02:12
So either you can.
02:15
First preview this.
02:22
Or directly click the use button when you click the use button.
02:30
The template will appear on your work area.
02:46
So here you can see that template opens up. 
02:50
So we worked upon but.
02:53
Ohh the whole library, my whole library fountain is not there. 
02:57
I want it to be there. 
03:00
I want to make changes according to me. 
03:03
So for that purpose here in the blue line there is there are two options Edit and create. 
03:09
I will change this from edit to create.
03:13
By clicking once on this button. 
03:15
So as soon as I opt for the create option, my library comes back and now I can do any changes I wish to invite.
03:26
Slides. 
03:27
So for the very first slide, it is written in 1776 now.
03:36
The year is for the American independence, but for India it's 1947 and in fact we have a date 15 August. 
03:43
So I'm going to change it. 
03:45
Double click on this text and I'm here going to write on.
03:51
August.
03:54
, 1947 and of course under exchange it a little bit on both sides with these black dots.
04:05
And.
04:07
It just needed the center.
04:11
OK, missed something. 
04:13
It's on August 15.
04:17
1947 India got its independence, so I've written the dates, changed it.
04:24
In the second slide it is we said bye bye to England.
04:29
So it could be same for both America and India because both the countries got their independence from England. 
04:35
But to just make a slight difference, I'm going to change this England to Britishers double clicking on it.
04:53
Interesting and rich.
04:56
And then moving on to 3rd slide, here it is and the independent America was born. 
05:02
Of course here also I need to change this text. 
05:05
Instead of America, I will write India.
05:12
And independent India was born. 
05:14
Then for the next slide. 
05:16
Now this line, the land of the free and the home of the brave is perfect. 
05:22
But this flag is a problem for me. 
05:25
So what I can do here is I will click on this flag.
05:30
And go with the option of swap. 
05:33
This swap option allows me to change any kind of prop to with some other prop.
05:41
So click on the swap option, the prop.
05:46
Library appears and here I can search for new flag. 
05:51
In this block search props I'm going to write.
05:56
Indian flag.
06:00
Enter this and these flags appear. 
06:03
Now I have to find one for India.
06:17
Crawling down I will get.
06:22
OK so I don't have a flag like this but I have this circle circular tag. 
06:28
I'm going to click on this and it has been exchanged. 
06:32
Now I can adjust this according to myself my requirement. 
06:36
I also want to change the background of this slide since it's white.
06:42
There is merging into it, so yes, crossing this and going for a background.
06:53
I'm going to pick up a simple color background, so this or maybe this light color background.
07:02
Now for the next slide, it is.
07:06
So grab your families, your pets, your food and your blankets. 
07:10
Now this slide requires few changes. 
07:13
The first one is this flag. 
07:15
This is an American flag and I need to go with an Indian flag. 
07:21
But since I have searched earlier, Indian flag is not available in my.
07:27
Now I believe so yes, I can go with some other flat. 
07:31
It doesn't represent a country. 
07:33
It could be a simple.
07:36
Plug searching for it.
07:47
So I think I can go on with the white color flag.
07:52
It doesn't represent the country and I can now flip it.
07:59
So yes, I'm done. 
08:00
I have changed the flag. 
08:03
The second change I think I should make is in and your blankets, since in India the Independence Day comes in August and we don't need.
08:16
Blankets at that time of season. 
08:18
We don't use blankets at that time of season. 
08:21
So I'm going to change this also.
08:27
I'm going to write here maybe.
08:32
And your clothes.
08:39
You goodnight pencil clothes or anything you wish to.
08:45
You can think of and make some change over here.
08:51
After this, now I will go to this next slide.
08:56
So does return head on outside. 
08:58
So this is good enough. 
09:00
I don't need to make a change in this slide. 
09:03
I can leave it as this. 
09:05
But I will make few changes. 
09:07
First of all I'm going to change this background. 
09:10
Since it is saying hidden outside, I'm going to take an outdoor background. 
09:14
For that I need to go to locations.
09:16
When did the background library?
09:22
OK. 
09:23
And in locations?
09:27
I need to choose an outdoor location maybe?
09:31
So finding for it OK, I feel this one is good enough.
09:36
On this changing the position of exhibit.
09:44
And I believe this color of text is not going on with my background so I can make it change over here. 
09:52
Maybe a color that would go with my backgrounds?
09:58
I need to choose.
10:00
That is absolutely fine.
10:04
You can take any color you think is going with your background.
10:14
Change the color updates and now I'm going to take a car maybe to represent this hidden outside.
10:22
Going to drops and then drops. 
10:24
I'm going to search for a car.
10:33
You can search for any God.
11:01
Searching for car and entering the button, pressing the enter button, choosing a card for myself and changing its size a little bit and flipping the page since my arrow.
11:16
Things that I can say that's like.
11:20
To my right hand side of course.
11:23
Yes, I'm done with this.
11:26
This looks amazing.
11:32
Now moving on to the 7th slide, it is and enjoy the festivities, especially the fireworks and the sounds good, but in India we don't do much of fireworks at our Independence Day. 
11:46
So I need to make two changes over here instead of.
11:50
And works. 
11:51
I'm going to write. 
11:53
Maybe.
11:55
Since this release special element every Indian are enjoys. 
11:59
So yes, I'm going to take a break instead.
12:12
And positioning it little bit according to my cell from the center. 
12:17
So here's here. 
12:19
I'm done now for the next slide.
12:24
Happy Independence Day America so the change I need to make else with the.
12:31
I can see I need to change America into India. 
12:35
So yes, double clicking on it, Max spacing and typing India.
12:41
And the exclamatory sign.
12:48
So yes, I'm done here.
12:51
Now I have edited this slide according to me. 
12:54
I can add images or you know whatever you want. 
12:57
I'm going to change the background color of this slide also.
13:04
So I'm going to background and.
13:11
With the background color maybe?
13:15
I can choose any one of them. 
13:18
This looks prettier so I'm going to take this one.
13:27
So yes, my.
13:33
Addicted Power 2 is ready, so this is how I can take up any, you know, existing existing designed templates from PowerPoint. 
13:44
There are so many for marketing for birthday wishes, for birthday greetings, wedding invitations and happy holidays.
13:53
Halloweens. 
13:53
There are so many templates that have been designed by the powerful and we don't have to work too much upon them. 
14:02
We just need to select the template according to our need and then edit that. 
14:08
We can add images, change background characters, whatever we want to handle.
14:13
It saves us a lot of time and energy in your home. 
14:17
When we start making a temp about doing video, we need to think a lot. 
14:23
We need to choose a background, characters, animations, everything. 
14:26
We have to adjust for ourselves. 
14:28
So this saves a lot of time. 
14:30
We can just start what we require from the.
14:34
Already of the templates and edit it according to ourselves. 
14:38
This is going to help us a lot. 
14:41
So I hope you guys enjoyed today's session and we'll see you in the next session. 
14:47
Bye bye, take care.

Hello everyone and welcome back to our session. 
00:16
So today is the last class. 
00:18
In today's session I would be introducing you to some features of Paulton we have not used yet, but yes, we can make very amazing videos using those features.
00:31
May have saved them for for the last session because they're not used much, but definitely they they can play a very important role while designing your presentation videos or maybe some personal videos too. 
00:46
For that today I'm again going with the blank poutine option.
00:51
Time Since I've told you many times, I always prefer going with the cartoon look.
00:58
So.
01:02
Going forward, the cartoon look.
01:08
So the very first thing I would like to tell you all that that while designing a powder, you don't need to switch on to one look only. 
01:16
Suppose I'm going to take a character.
01:19
From this.
01:21
A cartoon look I took off Addictive and now what I want to do is I want a character from a different look. 
01:29
So it's very simple. 
01:31
You can see here at the right top corner that there is an option. 
01:36
There is a thin cartoon loop so I can switch the looks in between and can.
01:41
Always go on with.
01:44
Changing the looks throughout my video so that I can add variety to my characters and make a really amazing and interesting video. 
01:53
So yes, you can switch the locks within creating your power tool.
02:00
And also you have you can see in this specials folder the last folder.
02:09
Which is some amazing features and options. 
02:12
There is one.
02:14
Ohh.
02:19
Italy would be able to see that there's sorry.
02:26
There is one amazing feature you can see that is.
02:31
This mini feature This is a very you know, funny. 
02:35
I can call this feature as some.
02:39
Like those whose faces are missing. 
02:42
So you can click your and your family or your friend pictures and paste them in this and you know, create a story with these characters. 
02:52
This, the video created using these characters is just so amazing, I can say.
03:00
You know, really funny and I'm just really enjoying. 
03:03
Video would be created using these characters. 
03:06
Image can be uploaded from the computer easily. 
03:09
I have told how to upload the image earlier also, I'm not going to repeat it. 
03:16
So yes, these are some features, very amazing features.
03:19
One feature I would like to, you know, introduce you.
03:25
2 is an ABA teacher. 
03:27
Suppose I'm going to now take a character from this the pleasant style folder.
03:35
And I'm going to take this character saying walking boots.
03:40
When I take this character.
03:43
What you can see is that my character is in walking posts but it is not moving from one position to another. 
03:49
Now say if I want it to move from point A to point B like this to point A, and this is point BI wanted to move from here to the towards the end of the slide. 
04:00
What I'm going to do is I'm going to use the A to B featuring.
04:05
For that I would be going to settings and here you can see and feature with all A to B Click on this and the character will be duplicated or duplicate character will appear on your screen. 
04:18
Hold on to this character and take it to the position you want your character. 
04:23
So yes.
04:24
When I'm done, play this slide and here you can see.
04:29
That now my character appears broken. 
04:31
Now this now she was walking very fast. 
04:34
If I want to decrease its speed for speed what I would do is I would click the character on timeline and here you will see that a dark blue area you can see with the sign of A to B.
04:49
So I have two hold on to this area and increase it.
04:54
When I will increase the area, the speed of the character would decrease so carefully.
05:01
Like this?
05:03
So isn't this an amazing feature? 
05:06
If you want to move your characters, you can, you know, move a car with this can move. 
05:12
Try that too.
05:14
I'm going to take a prop.
05:18
God.
05:25
Get your card.
05:30
Now what I want is like my card should enter from the left right side of the screen and move towards the left side. 
05:39
For that what I'm going to do is.
05:48
I'm going to personal.
05:52
Keep my card outside of the screen like this from the right to the right of screen and now click and click on its settings and again choose for the A to B feature. 
06:09
Now this is being duplicated so.
06:12
Hold on to the duplicated car and put it outside of the screen on the left side. 
06:18
Now when I play this you will see.
06:25
So I think that is amazing enough.
06:32
This conference will now be recorded.
06:36
Now you can see that my car enters from the right and moves towards the left. 
06:42
The speed I can control the speed of car also again by increasing this darker blue area. 
06:47
Just left click on the end of this area, drag it towards the right and you can now decrease the speed.
06:56
Like this. 
06:57
So this gives really amazing effect of movements. 
07:00
You can similarly increase the speed also like if you reduce this KBR.
07:07
OK, now play this slide so you will see the car moves in a very fast.
07:14
So this is how amazingly you can use the AB feature for the movement and this feature can be used for some other things also. 
07:24
I will let you know suppose.
07:27
You want to create, uh, playing Selena play playground scene and you want that when you're corrected, kicks the ball or a ball counts.
07:37
So to give it a real effect, you can use this feature in a very amazing manner. 
07:42
I will show you, go to props and search for a ball.
07:54
If I take this ball only keeping it here now I want my ball to move from this position to this position, this right corner of my powerful. 
08:03
So for that again, I've been going to pick this A to be feature.
08:10
When I take it, what happens is.
08:13
And you know, put it here. 
08:15
But this time what I'm going to do is.
08:23
You you are. 
08:24
You must be able to create this double sided arrow where you used to rotate the things. 
08:30
I'm going to rotate my ball to the.
08:35
The wall is a should be around, you know, 200 something degrees 250 maybe 60 something. 
08:42
Don't get it in the line of 300, just 200.
08:47
30 OK I'm going 252 I have taken so around 250 even take and now I'm going to increase the time until bit. 
08:56
So now what happens is when I play the slide my ball will move from position A to B but will get 1 rotation.
09:07
Then give it a very amazing effect, a real effect of the flying ball.
09:15
I can't repeat it once again.
09:19
I have this ball, I will go to its settings, go for it to be feature. 
09:24
I will the duplicate ball. 
09:26
I will keep it on the right corner and then rotate it to around 250°.
09:35
And then?
09:37
Increase the WD on timeline and play.
09:47
So this is how it is.
09:59
This conference will now be recorded.
10:03
So I'm going to, you know.
10:07
About them?
10:11
The background could be. 
10:13
I'm going to take it from the location folder only and.
10:20
Ohh it could be a school or office background I guess.
10:30
OK, since say, if I take this background now here, the board is here, and suppose my character is standing here near in between the discs, I'm going to take a character.
10:45
So I'm going to take this character only in walking through.
10:50
So say my character is here.
10:53
Standing here around, flip its face and it wants to go to this board. 
10:58
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this Acre B feature.
11:06
And my character now near the board.
11:13
But I will help decrease its size because I want to, you know, create that in depth or distance effect. 
11:21
So once I'm done with this play this slide, you can see see that here this happens. 
11:28
I can, you know, reduce the.
11:32
I think it is some time.
11:35
Use the speed so that looks more realistic.
11:43
Like this so.
11:48
This is amazing. 
11:50
Now I want.
11:54
I am going to use this same feature. 
11:56
It would be feature for an image to give it a scrolling effect. 
12:00
For that I'm going to take a blank slide. 
12:03
First of all I'm going to take an image now.
12:08
An image you can take that is available in your computer.
12:15
Say I'm gonna take the stay home, stay here, stay committed. 
12:19
We used to create that animation.
12:23
Ohh cool now in this video. 
12:25
So you just increase its size to its largest?
12:29
Like this. 
12:30
And now what I'm going to do is just hold on to this black dot just at the center of the picture and the blue flower center of the picture. 
12:43
I'm going to extend this picture a little outside the slide so there's like this half.
12:50
Should be in the side. 
12:51
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to its settings and go for this to be featured. 
12:58
Now this is the duplicate feature. 
13:00
The original picture is.
13:03
Beneath the duplicate pictures. 
13:05
So adjusting my duplicate picture over here and now I'm going to do is I'm going to keep this picture here.
13:15
You can see the arrow is pointed towards upward. 
13:17
Now when I play this slide, it will give us scrolling effect.
13:22
Reducing the speed, it's totally greasing the time, the bit. 
13:26
And now when I play this, you can see it will give the scrolling image to the textbook image like this. 
13:34
So this looks very good. 
13:36
So this is how amazingly you can use the. 
13:40
It could be featured with various things.
13:43
I'm going to repeat this image.
13:47
One, just take the image, the original image.
13:55
Ohh adjusted size to the fullest of the screen.
14:06
I'm now stretch it outside the lower side of the screen.
14:11
Like this?
14:13
It should be visible. 
14:15
Now go to settings 8 to be effect and now from here you can.
14:25
Here you have fixed send the image to the outer upper outer part so playing it and you will see that.
14:39
Let's get it done.
14:41
Solution which is like you can always, you know, reduce or increase the.
14:47
Speed of scrolls. 
14:48
So these were some features I wanted to tell you about in the last session. 
14:55
I hope you enjoyed learning with us had an amazing experience. 
15:00
So we do not do keep practicing what we have learned. 
15:05
This is a very.
15:07
Interesting, uh, software you can create your birthday invitations for the wishes for your fan friends. 
15:15
Add images and movements and characters and presentations, stories, videos and whatnot in this. 
15:22
So all the best and.
15:25
I hope you all will remain with us in our further course results. 
15:29
Thank you so much.
15:32
Goodbye. 

First class are introduced due to the various functions and features available in Power Tune and also to the characters, props, shapes, specials, images and videos that are available in the library of Power 2, So in today's class.
00:28
I will be introducing you. 
00:30
I will be teaching you to make a video using all those elements of the library.
00:39
From starting from scratch, that means a blank slide. 
00:42
So for that what I'm going to do is I'm going to this blank mountain option, since in my computer, in the version of Faulkner I'm using, the blank pouton option is here on the screen in some cases, in some other versions it could be available.
00:58
On the left hand side of the screen. 
01:01
So for now I'm going to blank out an option.
01:07
And as I told you in the previous class also.
01:15
Now when I opted for a black button option, then I'm asked to choose a look and the look I prefer going with is a cartoon look.
01:28
So after this what I have to do is.
01:33
I'm going to create a video.
01:36
To create awareness about coronavirus. 
01:38
So in that case, the very first step for my video is that in this slide, I'm going to choose a background that is the most important. 
01:48
So I am going to choose a background from locations.
01:54
When we Scroll down in the background option, so I will get a folder named Locations. 
02:01
From here I need to choose a background. 
02:04
It could be anything. 
02:06
Any background you would like you can choose say I'm going to choose this one.
02:14
So I have chosen this background and now I'm going to choose a character.
02:21
And the character I'm going to choose is from this Health and safety module.
02:29
On this I will be choosing a doctor this doctor character in a hello post. 
02:35
Since this is the very first slide, I want to wish hello to everyone. 
02:40
So I would be choosing this character in Halo 4.
02:46
And then moving it to the left side of my slide and making it a little bigger.
02:54
Increasing its size and then.
02:58
After this I will go to the text option.
03:03
In text I would go to text elements scrolling down the second folder is of text elements. 
03:10
I'm going to choose one of them say this second line first one. 
03:16
When I choose this I would now.
03:19
Gibraltar near Dekhna character Surat. 
03:22
It appears like the characteristic saying so I will add text over here and write head over everyone.
03:36
So yes, this is related to the text. 
03:38
Now the text is a little bit on the lower side. 
03:42
I want it to be at the center. 
03:45
So clicking left and holding on to it I will adjust.
03:50
Hello everyone like this.
03:53
Now after this what I'm I have to do is that my slide is too long. 
04:00
I mean just a hello slide shouldn't be 10 seconds long it would make it look boring or make the viewer lose interest so reducing its.
04:13
Time little bit I will, I think A5 or four or five second slide is enough to say hello. 
04:21
So keeping it 5 seconds and I would keep this hello everyone. 
04:25
Also one or 1 1/2 spin dated and my character enters this would give it a good look.
04:33
So after this I will go for another blank slide slide #2 In this slide I will go first to the shapes option on the.
04:48
The props option, the fourth option is props and the library. 
04:52
After props is shapes available. 
04:54
I will go to shapes and then shapes I will go to animated shapes. 
04:59
The second folder is of animated shapes. 
05:02
In animated shapes I can choose, I'm going to choose this, you know, bubble bursting effect kind of.
05:08
I have when animation animated shape, so you can choose any of them. 
05:13
I'm going to close this transparent.
05:17
And I'm going to make it really bigger.
05:22
Bigger in the sense it is should be the same size as my slide. 
05:29
So yes, this is going to give it a very good look. 
05:35
And after that I'm going to go to text.
05:40
Now you need to take care that this bubble burst I have used and the text I'm going to add should be very near very close on the timeline. 
05:52
And also again, this timeline needs not to be 10 seconds longer, so I would reduce it seconds.
06:00
The time and I would like to keep it 6 seconds so that what I'm going to write is readable and is even not too much longer. 
06:09
For that I'm going to add title.
06:12
And here I'm going to write this.
06:18
Today.
06:23
Aye, aye.
06:26
Going to.
06:29
Don't you?
06:35
Steps.
06:37
1.
06:39
Protect and.
06:43
Ohh so.
06:48
Tom Cruise.
06:53
Like this?
06:56
So yes, this is what I have written today. 
06:59
I'm going to show you tips on protecting ourselves from coronavirus. 
07:03
Now this appears little bit short to me, small to me. 
07:07
So to increase the size of text, I'm going to edit the size. 
07:11
I will double click on this certain size and type here 80.
07:17
This size is good enough, but since this is, I want to extend it to other sides of the slide. 
07:25
Also like this, the black dots on the side helps me to exchange it. 
07:31
So this one has come like yeah, now one thing is that I can.
07:37
Either the background white and the text black. 
07:40
This looks good or you can change the color of background. 
07:44
You can go for the background option and pick any light color background. 
07:48
So this if you want to this whatever you color you like you can get this and also you can change the text.
07:57
Color. 
07:57
But now what I'm going to do is I want that this text should that the bubble I have given it its back in the beginning of this slide should burst into text should pop out. 
08:10
So for that case I have to go to settings of this text, I have to select the text and.
08:17
Go to settings. 
08:18
After this I have to go to effects option in effects. 
08:22
I told in the previous class also that there are two options Enter effective, exit effect. 
08:28
So for enter effect I'm going to choose the pop.
08:32
And for the exit effect it would be fade.
08:36
So yes, I'm done with this and now I want to play this slide. 
08:39
It is like.
08:41
This this gives a very good look to my slide like the bubble boast and the text also comes on the text also pops out. 
08:53
So these I'm ready with my two slides depicting this. 
08:57
First I have chosen an animated shape in the shapes.
09:03
Option I have an animated chips folder. 
09:06
From there I have taken this bubble burst and then I have written a text by choosing a title. 
09:14
So I've written text, resized it according to myself, changed the background and in text by after selecting the text.
09:23
Going to settings effects, I have put the entry vectors pop and Executive Victor's feet.
09:35
So yes, I'm done with the first two slides. 
09:38
For the third slide, I'm going to start with the tips and for that.
09:44
Again, I have to choose a background and for the background I'm not going to take a simple color. 
09:50
Now I will go. 
09:52
I will Scroll down the backgrounds in after the location folder there is an option of color background, so I'm going to choose one out of them.
10:01
I will try to use all these backgrounds once from SO.
10:06
You can take any one of them. 
10:09
I would like to go for a double shift kind of background. 
10:14
This looks good to me. 
10:15
And again going back to text adding title.
10:19
What title I would write here?
10:23
Step one.
10:26
And I'm going to drag it to the left corner of my slide.
10:32
Again, choosing, going for a title and writing over here.
10:40
Wear mask.
10:45
Your mask and now changing its size. 
10:48
Size 50 is too small. 
10:51
I would go for size 100.
10:55
And drag it to the left side of my powtoon, my slide and then going to settings and in settings again I have to choose it. 
11:06
The effect could be anything you wish to like. 
11:09
I'm going to choose this appear.
11:14
Effective and for exit I'm going for.
11:20
See down for exit. 
11:22
I'm going for down.
11:26
And now to denote this wear a mask, I'm going to go to characters and then characters again to the health and safety folder. 
11:36
And I can choose any of these characters on the 1st 3 characters like if I choose this first one. 
11:44
So there are.
11:46
There is one uh pose of this character of covering, so this can demonstrate what I want to say very easily. 
11:55
Choosing this and dragging to the right side of my slide.
12:02
Increasing its size for a little bit and flipping its face as I want it to look to the left. 
12:08
So flipping its face. 
12:10
This slide looks good enough and now what I need to do is adjust the timings on the timeline so you can see my character is at around 9 1/2 second and.
12:20
My text is at around one in one and a half second. 
12:24
Now when I will play the slide there would be a huge time difference between my text and my character. 
12:30
That won't look good. 
12:32
So I'm going to pick my character up from here, left click and hold it and drag it to the 3rd or 4th 2nd.
12:40
Now again A10 second slide over here is not required to reducing some seconds.
12:47
I would love keeping it up for about 6 seconds. 
12:49
That's enough for me.
12:52
So this is these are my first three slides. 
12:55
For the 4th slide again going to blank slide option.
13:00
Choosing a background.
13:04
For the background I did I go. 
13:07
I chosen from color background. 
13:10
I will choose from an abstract background.
13:16
Umm, you can choose any. 
13:18
I'm going to choose this one. 
13:20
This looks good to me. 
13:22
After this now again going to text and writing Tip 2 go to add title and write.
13:33
Tip 2.
13:39
Dragging it to the left corner.
13:42
And then?
13:46
Again, going for a title and typing over here.
13:54
Wash your hands.
13:57
Watch your hands.
14:02
With soap.
14:07
For 20 seconds.
14:14
Yep.
14:35
And now I will drag this to the left side of my slide and increase its size. 
14:43
Here I can keep the size 70.
14:48
And extended little bit. 
14:49
Now for this I don't have any character depicting my washer hand sign. 
14:54
So I would like to I would go to download an image for it and for that I will open another tab in my browser only and type here.
15:06
Washing hand.
15:10
But I will add one word over here that is cartoon because I'm going, you know, I'm have chosen a cartoon look and if I, you know, put in kind of image in this, that wouldn't go with my outlook. 
15:25
So yes, I would add a word cartoon and then download any pictures.
15:31
See if I go with this picture, only this image.
15:36
Right clicking on it and saving it in my computer.
15:43
It is being saved in the downloads.
15:47
Save.
15:49
And after this I'm going back to my button and here I will go to image in image images I will go to upload image uploads and I will upload that image from web outlook. 
16:05
This is what I downloaded one and this.
16:09
Just appeared on my screen. 
16:11
Now let's select this image. 
16:13
There is an option to crop it. 
16:15
I will I can adjust the cropping but this is fine for me. 
16:20
So just enter this. 
16:21
The image has been cropped, now resizing it according to my need.
16:27
Umm.
16:32
And then I can, you know, put the effects on both the text and the image. 
16:38
For text, I would go to settings, OK, and I can go here with the right effect and then exit. 
16:46
There could be no effect.
16:50
For this image.
16:53
Again, going to settings effects like for this I'm going to choose the left effect but accompanied with the hand.
17:03
I'm choosing this first hand, then in the second exit effect I'm going to choose the.
17:11
Right effect.
17:14
For exit, I'm going to choose the right effect and.
17:19
With the hand again.
17:23
So I'm done with this, but again this slide is too longer. 
17:27
I will reduce it to 6 seconds only and put like some gap between.
17:39
Between this image and my text. 
17:41
So dragging my image to say 3 second. 
17:44
Now when I play this, this appears like.
17:54
So I'm done with my 4th slide also.
18:17
So after the 4th slide I should go for the fifth one for that going to this blank slide option.
18:58
When I choose the fifth slide again, I have first I need to go for a background.
19:06
For the background I will go for go to background and since I have chosen one from locations, color background, abstract background, now I will go to this textures. 
19:19
The last folder is textures and I think there are only two.
19:25
Accounts available so I can choose any one of them, so I choose this one.
19:30
So again after this going to text I typed in.
19:37
So here I would write step number.
19:42
Port.
19:45
Taking it to again the left corner, again adding the title and here I would write social distancing.
19:59
Distancing.
20:04
Dragging this text to the left side, increasing the text size could be 80 around and then.
20:15
Extending a little bit.
20:18
And I can also put some effect on this text.
20:24
Hey this time which are the type and for exit either could be no effect or fade anything you prefer going with.
20:32
After this.
20:34
I'm willing to represent the social distancing. 
20:37
I have something in my mind or trick I have found out. 
20:41
So for that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose any character from here. 
20:46
Say I'm going to choose this third character and here there is an pose of scared. 
20:52
I'm going to tease. 
20:53
Take this two times.
20:54
You have to click on it twice so I get 2 characters like this.
21:01
No.
21:22
They did this in in adjusted their sizes. 
21:25
I would flip one of the face.
21:29
So that they appear to be standing opposite to each other in scared to meet each other representing social distancing. 
21:35
So here you can see when I play.
21:53
In the problem I was talking about, the slide is too longer and my character comes too late. 
21:59
So dragging my character is a bit earlier, set 5 seconds and reducing the time to 8 seconds.
22:06
Like this now playing this slide.
22:18
I need to change the animations of my characters or that clicking on the first one I would.
22:26
Go to Effects and what I'm going to do.
22:31
I will get this correct. 
22:33
I put the up effect for the entire one and and the up effect for the exit 1-2, up for the enter and up for the exit in the similar manner for the second character. 
22:47
I'm going to put down effect for both of them but.
22:51
The entire effect also down and for exit effect also down.
22:59
So once I'm done with this, playing this slide.
23:11
So I think this looks amazing after 5th slide going to 6th slide.
23:18
Again, opting for a blank blank slide option and then choosing a background.
23:40
This time again I'm going to choose the color background.
24:04
So again, going to text a Titan.
24:11
Type.
24:13
Number.
24:16
5.
24:20
Or I should say.
24:26
We're done with the 2.
24:29
3.
24:31
Project 1.
24:35
Your tip 3. 
24:36
Game tip 4.
24:43
Step #4.
24:58
Again adding title.
25:32
The lighting, the text. 
25:33
You need to change some effects and size of this.
26:00
For effects, I'm choosing this time, this scale and exit. 
26:05
I'm putting no effect. 
26:07
So to depict this, don't touch your face over and over again. 
26:12
I'm going to characters and I'm going to, you know, the office, the office folder in this.
26:22
Here I'm going to take any one character, so this one I'm going to take it. 
26:27
In this I'm going to take a pose of thinking, or you can say an idea, I guess choosing this.
26:36
So you can have those in two. 
26:38
So deleting 1 so that is in the in the pose for it. 
26:42
I'm going to choose the idea of pose.
26:47
And again, flipping its face like this.
26:52
OK this idea pose.
26:55
I think it's not going great, so changing the pose to thinking.
27:04
So yes, this looks good.
27:07
I have. 
27:08
I'm done with my 6th slide also for the 7th slide.
27:18
Again, choosing the background, I'm going with a very simple technical color background.
27:28
Are people going with some light colored backgrounds?
27:32
So this now again going to text a title.
27:39
Tip number.
27:42
5.
27:48
Dragging it to the left.
27:52
And then add in title.
28:14
So changing its size and orientation and then going to keep it.
28:47
Ohh, this time I'm going to take this effect though this one and for exit.
28:54
On the tools for this down effect.
28:59
So here's what I'm done with this. 
29:02
Again, I don't have any character to depict Chase home. 
29:05
Stay safe. 
29:06
So going back to my browser and typing here, it's just.
29:10
If stay home, stay stiff, stiff stiff cartoon.
29:36
So choosing any one of them, so this one, downloading save images, downloads save, going back to my powtoon, uploading the image from the image options of course.
29:54
Upload and choosing this open.
30:00
Then I need to crop this image, crop sorry hydros flip by chance crop. 
30:07
I think it crops perfectly enter and resizing the image.
30:25
Choosing any effect for the image.
30:38
In India and exit, both have chosen pop.
30:49
For the last slide I'm going to choose from the image background. 
30:54
It's going to background.
30:59
Sorry.
31:19
I have I have chosen one image background for after dad going to text and this is the last slide so it will be thank you slide that title.
31:34
Thank you and I'm going to change some font this time. 
31:38
You can change the font every time and every flight. 
31:42
That's your choice.
32:05
I'm changing its size to say 100 or 110.
32:13
Again, I've created since little bits smaller, so 150 maybe?
32:21
Miss Hogan.
32:22
So after this thank you. 
32:56
Now I can put any effect on this. 
33:00
Any effect you want to go with?
33:10
I'm going with this effect for enter and exit. 
33:14
I'm will be going for this first in the reveal option, the first pick.
33:22
So I'm done with my.
33:26
Whole powtoon again I what I wanted to say is that in this case in this slide the time is too much. 
33:33
I mean 10 seconds for saying thank you is too much, so reducing it to just 4 seconds in the previous slide. 
33:41
Also the image is too late.
33:44
So dragging it to the 4th, 2nd and reducing some time.
33:50
The six second slide is enough.
33:53
And in this also the character at 4th, 2nd and making reducing the slide to 7 seconds is enough.
34:04
And I think we are done so playing this all from starting.
34:10
I will go to the first slide.
34:15
And.
34:17
Move my cursor to the zero second and play.
34:40
So I think I'm done with my powtoon, so I can now give choose a music for it. 
35:19
For that I will go to this.
35:27
I'm sorry.
35:30
I will go to this option.
35:36
Click it and go for Add Music and here I will get a number of free sounds over here.
35:43
So I can choose any one of them.
35:47
So by playing this button you can play the sound, listen to it and if you feel like it's good, you can go for this use option. 
35:56
So yes, I have now added the sound to my video. 
35:59
So this was today's session. 
36:01

36:08

00:59
So in this there are various.
01:03

With simply drop and drag method then this is my time. 
10:56
This timeline you can see we have 10 seconds, 10 seconds initially, but I can then reduce its time or also increase its time up to 20 seconds.
11:08
Once they can no longer be 20, no longer than 20 seconds.
11:14
And then here you can adjust the timings on which you want your objects, blocks or characters to appear by simply dragging them ahead or back.
11:28
South misses how you can use various features in power tool to create some amazing pictures. 
11:35
Thank you. 
11:36
I hope you like this session and stay tuned for.
11:42
Making more amazing videos.
11:46
In part from our next session we will learn to make videos. 
11:50
Thank you and have a nice day. 

I have everyone. 
00:15
How are you all? 
00:17
Hope you all are doing good. 
00:19
So in the last session we learned we were designing our story in power tune and I think we completed our first five slides. 
00:30
Here it is with me so.
00:34
Completing it further, I'm going through this edit option. 
00:38
Uh, this. 
00:39
The templates have design are there are always available in my power tools on your.
00:47
Home page, so going on to the edit option.
00:53
It opens up.
00:55
And that I really.
00:58
And then ask me to edit it.
01:01
So yes, I'm.
01:04
It is here. 
01:06
So our first slide was our title slide in which we added the title, the design title.
01:15
And just seeing the text over it and the second slide, it was once there was a boy named John. 
01:22
We introduced her character then what he wanted to he wanted to buy a bicycle. 
01:28
In the fourth slide we introduced the problem. 
01:30
He was facing it in the 5th slide.
01:36
We acknowledge that one day he saw another boy with a nice bicycle. 
01:41
Now I want it.
01:44
Now today I will be completing this story. 
01:46
We have today 11 slides out of which five we have designed. 
01:50
So another six slides will be designing right now. 
01:52
So moving on to the next slide. 
01:54
But the side by side should skids and the boy fell down. 
01:58
For that I'm going to go into backgrounds and I need to take the same background that took in the 5th slide.
02:04
From the locations folder.
02:16
So.
02:20
I think I took this one. 
02:22
So yes going on with this one now. 
02:25
I wanted to depict that the boys cycles kids and the boy fell down. 
02:29
So I need to 1st add my characters, the character of John. 
02:33
I can add in this hard post only from the office folder.
02:48
So this was like an actor and I'm writing him in this sad who's only.
02:54
Since his side is unable to buy the bicycle and I will make him stand here near the pillow.
03:01
Increasing the size a little bit and now the boy I took earlier was from this the pleasant style.
03:10
Folder.
03:14
So yes, I take this boy and this time I'm going to take him in.
03:21
I think you can either take him and you can take him in any pose. 
03:25
You can take him in sad pose, walking pose, whatever you wish to say. 
03:28
If I take it in and then sad post.
03:31
Now what will I do is you can see this double ended arrow besides every picture you select, every image or every top you select that is to rotate it.
03:45
I'm talking about this double sided arrow. 
03:47
So you will notice that when you take your cursor to this arrow it the color gets darkened and the arrow shape also changes a little bit. 
03:57
So yes, when this happens I would need to lift, click on my mouse, hold it and.
04:03
Rotate it. 
04:03
So I'm going to take it for the 90° around and decrease its size like this and place it on the road over here. 
04:12
Here's fallen down. 
04:14
Now I will do the same with the bicycle. 
04:17
Bicycle I have to search from the props only.
04:26
So I will take the same bicycle.
04:29
Size is good enough. 
04:31
If yours is big, you can you know.
04:35
Adjust the size and then rotate it also so that it gives us the effect of all and down.
04:44
So this was my sixth slide. 
04:46
I took the same background and then I introduced my Crypto John in sad pose. 
04:52
And then my this character, I took it it also in the sad pose and then rotated it for the 90°. 
05:00
And then I did the same with the bicycle, took the bicycle.
05:05
This, this size and and I think till today, a little bit, 2:30 or 40°, whatever you feel like you can do. 
05:13
Then comes the 7th.
05:16
John rushes to help him and takes him to the doctor.
05:20
So here I want OK sorry in the 6th slide again. 
05:24
I think we need to reduce the time. 
05:27
I am keeping it for six seconds longer, 6 or 7 seconds longer only and then merging this character in bicycle.
05:36
And uh, you need to remember that the animation should be same, so I would first see what effects are for the bicycle. 
05:44
The bicycle, it's failed in both entry and exit, so I will do the same for my boy.
05:52
Selected Go to Settings, Effects, Enter, Fade or exit is also done.
06:02
Now moving to the 7th slide, the next slide, John rushes to help him and takes him to the doctor. 
06:10
For that again I need to take the same background. 
06:13
You can select the backgrounds once also for all the three.
06:19
So.
06:21
Taking it.
06:28
It doesn't locations folder contact. 
06:30
So once I'm done with this now, John rushes to help him and takes him to the doctor. 
06:37
You can change the color of text if you want if you feel it's not readable.
06:45
You always do this.
06:48
And then?
06:53
Ohh now again my characters I need to introduce and just tell me.
07:19
For the this character and the bicycle I will be doing the same things.
07:31
Yeah, only. 
07:32
And the same with the bicycle also.
07:52
Taking this and putting it in my testing.
07:56
This mission and now I need to introduce my character John.
08:04
For that.
08:08
Ohh I will take it from the office folder.
08:17
This I have to add in again the sad pose, but this time I don't have to keep it here, I will have to keep it here.
08:26
Near him and the little bit smaller in size from the gate the distance.
08:33
So. 
08:33
And now I will flip his face.
08:39
Like this?
08:41
And for its effects.
08:46
I will choose enter right, enter left and exit also and exit right.
08:53
What I can go for noises in the exit?
08:58
Sudan.
09:01
In this slide also you need to.
09:05
Click this space.
09:08
Done.
09:10
Now coming to the 8th slide. 
09:12
In this it is written. 
09:14
Then John helps the boy to reach his home.
09:18
For that what I can do is.
09:21
Now I need a background that is depicting a house or something. 
09:25
You can create it either take a plain color and and you may get a picture of house or something like that. 
09:31
But I will be going with the directly background.
09:37
Locations I can find the background that looks like outside of home.
09:52
See, I think this one.
09:59
So once I'm done with this now again I will be introducing my characters. 
10:04
I can introduce both of my characters together.
10:14
Go on inside pools.
10:20
And then my another director of that boy from the pleasant style folder.
10:31
He twins at pools.
10:42
So both of them are the roads.
10:47
Adjusting the size.
10:50
So once I'm done.
10:54
Now the cycle is left. 
10:55
You want to add the cycle. 
10:57
You can. 
10:58
If you don't want to add, that's also OK.
11:02
But I'm ending it.
11:11
So they're doing this.
11:23
The cycle of violence, Jake. 
11:24
So my this slide is also ready once I play this.
11:33
So you can merge the cycle with this boy and then reduce time your first slide to 6 seconds.
11:45
So I think I'm done for the 7th slide. 
11:47
Also I needed to reduce the time.
11:52
And you can also merge.
11:55
This boy on the right side.
11:59
So I'm moving to the next slide, the 9th slide. 
12:04
It is the boy belonged to a rich family, so his father gifted John a bicycle as a reward for His Highness. 
12:12
So I think again going for the background, I would prefer a background that.
12:20
Represents an inside of a house, so I can prove it anyone.
12:31
You can also choose anyone background, so I'm choosing this.
12:38
And for this also.
12:44
And here now I need to add my connectors. 
12:46
John, John's father. 
12:47
So you know, John's father, John, the boy and the boy's father.
12:52
So I'm going to take the John and the boy's father from the office folder.
13:05
Yeah, I'm going to take in those thinking pose.
13:10
Sir.
13:14
Then his father.
13:17
The boy's father.
13:26
And.
13:31
Idea Pose.
13:35
And you need to flip his face.
13:38
Voice Join.
13:41
And then the boy. 
13:42
And the boy was from the pleasant side folder.
13:48
And this time I'm going to take him into simple sand pools standing over here.
13:58
I know the bicycle again and it looks like from pops this time I won't be taking the same bicycle.
14:11
I took this.
14:20
I know you can change the color of five seconds if you want to say a black color.
14:26
No, you are sleeping. 
14:29
Follow whatever and flip this so.
14:34
This was our ninth slide. 
14:36
Now moving to the 10th slide, that is the last slide. 
14:40
Here it is. 
14:41
John was happy to receive the gift. 
14:44
Now either you can take the background you took earlier in second, third slide, the House of John or you can take any plain color background.
14:54
As I'm going to take one.
14:59
The background color.
15:03
I'm doing OK.
15:08
Pictures.
15:10
This kind of a color, then I'm going to take the bicycle.
15:19
The same bicycle.
15:25
So try keeping its size the same as the previous one.
15:30
Change the color.
15:33
Flip to bicycle with help.
15:38
Then you have to now just introduce the character in a happy pose, the character of John that is available in the Office folder.
15:54
The English character in Happy Booze.
15:57
And putting it over here.
16:03
So I hope you are done.
16:09
So we have completed our story and I need to reduce this timings to 6 seconds. 
16:14
I've, I think I've not kept any slide more than six or seven seconds. 
16:18
Now it's the time to design that model. 
16:21
The model is be kind to everyone around you. 
16:24
It will come back to you for that. 
16:26
What you can take is.
16:28
Then directly go to the background and selector. 
16:31
Beautiful kind of background. 
16:32
But this time I'm going not going to backgrounds. 
16:35
In fact I'm going to.
16:49
I'm going to specials and in specials in winter holidays. 
16:53
Sorry in the events folder not winter holidays and the events folder in the last there are.
17:00
Very beautiful textured backgrounds I'm going to take.
17:06
These backgrounds so the second one of them. 
17:10
This looks good to me now. 
17:12
So now designing my model for it, I can select a good font first of all.
17:23
I choose this one.
17:26
No something.
17:39
OK I took this free spirit 1 and now increasing its size to say 80.
17:46
Yes, that looks good. 
17:48
So adjusting it in the center and now what I need to do is I need to, you know, create a good effects on it. 
17:56
What I'm going to do is in the events folder only you will get this kind of shape.
18:04
This is moving shape and I'm going to take this.
18:10
This shape I'm going to take.
18:15
Four times, clicking once.
18:20
You think it over here?
18:24
Just think it's size then taking another one.
18:30
Keeping it here. 
18:31
First of all, flipping this.
18:35
Uh, you know.
18:38
Now it just switch size.
18:50
I'm done with this.
18:56
Now the similar thing I will do.
19:03
We're in the bottom.
19:15
Taking one.
19:21
I'm putting it at the bottom.
19:26
Dining it's size.
19:32
Again taking one.
19:36
Keeping it at the bottom.
19:40
Flipping it.
19:42
And changing its size.
19:48
All the four should be of almost same sizes.
19:53
They put security, they would look to the effect. 
19:57
So once I'm done with this.
20:00
Adjusting their positions and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to merge all these 4 shapes together on my timeline.
20:09
Please observe my timeline carefully. 
20:12
I merged them all together and then reducing the slide time long 7 seconds. 
20:20
Now I need to put some effect on my this text.
20:28
I wanted to say in a type effect.
20:33
Exit more effect.
20:36
So yes, I'm done with this.
20:40
And you can add, you know, flowers or boards over here also from this event folder only. 
20:47
But I think this simple look is.
20:51
Looking good so mindset plate you can see it.
21:00
This looks very this this look, this looks very good. 
21:04
You can also push it back a little bit these 4 shapes. 
21:08
So now playing it.
21:18
Yes, this looks amazing. 
21:20
So our story is ready.
21:23
Now you can add transitions to the every slide.
21:28
Being, uh, like when we play our story, what happened is the ones like shifts from another slide, so.
21:36
But I can now add transition in the slides. 
21:40
How to add transitions?
21:44
You can see these two boxes on my screen. 
21:47
The two boxes with an arrow or the red spot on my screen is on them. 
21:53
So you have to click on these boxes.
22:05
Can you click on these boxes? 
22:07
What happens is there are various transitions, basic executives stylized scam dot so you need to choose any one of them.
22:17
See I'm I took this stand up transition now when I shift from my first slide to another slide.
22:24
It will undergo transition from one slide dinner. 
22:27
I'm going to add transitions to all my slides here this part and you can look into your transitions and add whatever you like.
22:38
This time I'm going to take slice center and for her I'm going to take this roller.
22:48
After Ronald, maybe I would take a Swiggy, kind of.
22:55
Then.
22:56
Pull down.
22:59
Then OHH opposed.
23:07
And then you call.
23:13
Clipboard.
23:16
So you can always add transitions.
23:20
This time, a white fellow.
23:24
And my last transition would be so camera down. 
23:26
So I'm ready with my story. 
23:28
I'm going to play it. 
23:30
But before that I would like to add some music at the background. 
23:34
For that what I need to do is.
23:38
I can go to the sounds here on the library, this music option, or I can go here. 
23:45
You can see that it's got this.
23:50
On this when I click on this icon it will ask me what I want.
23:58
Clicking on it, what I what kind of music do I need to add? 
24:02
When I click on this, there are two options over add music. 
24:06
So I will go with the add music option for the entire power tool and then there are two folders premium sounds and free sounds.
24:16
I'm going to ask you for this free sounds option.
24:23
I'm from here I'm going to select any sound first play them from these play buttons or directly use them in your power say hi Swiss and now my slide is said now you can see the difference earlier on this icon it was just a speaker, but when this.
24:42
Waves or this sound icon is changed, it means the music has been added so.
24:50
I'm ready with it.
24:52
For right now, taking it to zero, I'm going to play my hopes too.
24:59
And to play the whole power 2 now I need to click on this blue button.
25:23
So this was the whole story we designed. 
26:21
I hope you all liked it.
26:25
And then I will see you in the next class. 
26:29
Goodbye and take.
